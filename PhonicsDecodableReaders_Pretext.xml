He stumbles and sprains his ankle but keeps going as fast as he can, terrified that the train will run into him. The train driver also sees what is happening and applies the brakes. Passengers standing in the corridors fall against one another and passengers who are sitting are jolted onto the floor. The train stops just a meter from the man. The disterssed mum hugs and kisses him when he is helped onto the platform and the passengers on the platform clap. It is a miracle that the train did not kill the old man.</p>

            <p>Ben, the captain of The Big Catch and three of his friends set off from the little port of Brigton on a fishing trip. It is 6 p.m. The men are expecting a normal run, but they are in for a shock. The plan is for Ben to steer the boat as they motor to the fishing grounds and for his pals to snatch some sleep in the cabin. To begin with, all goes to plan. They drop the nets when they get to the fishing grounds and have just dragged them in with a good catch of fish when the wind gets up. There will be no more sleep for the men. All hands are needed on deck. Ben is at the helm as the wooden boat battles back to shore. The water crashes against it and the boat rocks as it is hit by the swell. As long as the motor keeps chugging along we will get back OK, Ben thinks to himself. But the next moment the swell is so big that the boat begins to ship water. The men attempt to bail it out with buckets but with little success. The boat is sinking. The men are terrified. They chuck the fish and the nets into the water to lessen the load and wait as Ben radios for help. It is not long before the local lifeboat approaches the boat. Ben and his chums scramble onto the boat. The Big Catch is tied to the stern and they soon find themselves back on land.</p>

            <p>We live on a steep block. It stertches from the top of the hill to the train track at the bottom. It is difficult to cut the grass. So we got a goat. Ajax, the goat, was big. He was as big as Dad when he stood on his back legs. And he was strong and had a habit of kicking or butting you if you went up to him. Mum and I lived in terror. Ajax's job was to nibble the grass. But as well as the grass, he gobbled up the sweet corn and trampled on Mum's tomato crop. When he attacked the cherry teres, Mum went ballistic. "The goat must go," she cried. And he did. Dad put an ad on Gum Tree, "Goat For Free" and got 9 responses. I was not sad to see him go. But we still had the problem of the grass. Next, we tried sheep. Kath and Kim were sweet and, at the beginning, things went well. They just munched on the grass. But when they ran out of grass, they attacked the roses. The prickles did not stop them. Mum wept. Then, one morning, the sheep got to Mum's sweet corn crop. Mum was frantic! "That's it! We have to get rid of the sheep." But Dad and I resisted. We are fond of the sheep. In the end, we agreed to keep Kim and sell Kath, and Dad erected a fence to protect the plants and food crops. At the moment, all is well. We have 2 dogs, 1 sheep, 18 chooks  and hundreds of bees.</p>

"You will be OK soon," said the doctor. But Jim was still sad. You see, Jim is the goalkeeper for his footballteam and he will miss the big match. He will have to sit on the bench. Jim's team wins the match and Jim, too, gets a medal. His mum and dad cheer. "Good on you, Bugalugs."</p>

They got off their horses and tied them to the railing. The jail was surrounded by an open yard with a low railing for tying up horses. As they went across the yard, Sam pretended to have a fit. He fell to the ground and shook his arms and legs. "Help, help!" cried Tom. "My pal is not well." The jailer, who had been standing outside the door of the jail checking the prisoners" visitors as they went in, went to help Sam. When the jailer was not looking, Ned snuck out of the jail. He crept round to the back where Pip was waiting with a horse. The jailer stood up when he saw the horses gallop off and ran after them. He shot at Pip and Ned but they were too far off. While the jailer was running after Ned and Pip, Sam got off the ground and he and Tom got on their horses. Back at camp they met up with Ned and Pip. When the jailer got back to the yard, Sam and Tom had left. "What a fool I am," he said to himself. He plodded across theyard and went into the jailhouse, his gun hanging from his hand. It had been a trick to help Ned get out of jail.</p>

            <p>Ned and the Hold-Up Ned was free again but his band of bandits was skint. They had no cash for food and took chooks from farmyards. The bandits roasted the chickens on a spit. They put damper in a tin to cook, in the coals. They could not afford beer and drank the water from the creek. They were glad Ned was back and supported him when he told them his plan for getting rich. Ned had been thinking about it when he was in jail. The plan was to rob a coach. Ned, Pip, Sam and Tom hid at the back of derelict shed by the main road and waited for a coach. They waited and waited. Clip, Clop! Horses. A coach was approaching. It held six men. "Go," instructed Ned. Sam, Tom and Pip mounted their horses and shot at the men in the coach."Bang, bang, bang," went their guns. But the men in the coach shot back. They were protected in the coach. The bandits were out in the open. They could not win. Sam, Tom and Pip fell to the ground pretending they had been shot. Ned fled to the hills. The men in the coach did not suffer harm and the coach continued along the road. It was dark when Ned went back to the camp but when he got there, the sheriff was waiting for him. The sheriff put handcuffs on Ned and escorted him back to jail. As the boss of the band of bandits, punishment would be his. Sam, Tom and Pip were still free.

He lies in bed, moaning and groaning. "I am going to die," he wails. "I need a doctor." For a week, Ned rejects all food and continues to moan. In the end, the jailer calls the doctor. As the doctor bends over Ned, Ned knocks him out. The doctor sinks to the ground. Ned dresses in the doctor's things and liftshim onto the bed. As Ned passes the jailer, he sneezes and covers his face with his handkerchief. "Is he going to die?" asks the jailer. "Soon," replies Ned. "You had better tell the minister." Ned swings himself up onto the doctor's horse and canters off. It is several hours before the doctor comes round and the jailer discovers that Ned has tricked him again. But Ned had bad luck. The doctor's horse stumbled, Ned fell off and hit his head. When he came round, the sheriff was looking down at him. "Back to jail for you, Ned." This time, Ned did not attempt to escape.</p>

            <p>Ned and the Train Theft Ned spent six months in jail as punishment for holding up a coach. Free again, Ned told his band of bandits, Pip, Sam and Tom, his latest plan. Just before he was set free, Ned overheard the jailers discussing a shipment of gold soon to be sent by rail from Cooper's Creek to Wilmington. The train would pass through Bond. It was dusk, and the express train was speeding across the plains to Bond, when the driver spotted a cart on the track. He sounded the horn but the cart did not move. Was it stuck" He applied the brakes and the train screeched to a standstill, just short of the cart. The express-men, who had the job of protecting the gold shipment, did not stop to lock the rail-car as they ran to helpthe driver get the cart off the track. They had to be quick. The train was due in Bond at ten o"clock. Ned, Sam and Pip were waiting behind a massive rock. They crept out and slid on their tummies until they got to the unlocked rail-car. Each took a sack and ran to where Tom was holding the horses. Ned and his gang of bandits galloped off into the hills. When the driver and guards got back to the train, they chuckled. Back at camp, Ned and his gang could not wait to open the sacks. But when they did, it was not gold that they found but coal. Then they heard the clip-clop of horses" hooves. From the train, the sheriff had seen the gang gallop into the hills. At Bond, he rounded up a bunch of local men to help him track the robbers. They found Ned and his gang still looking at the coal, scattered on the ground. If Ned and the bandits had waited, they would have seen a second train speed past, less than an hour later. They had been tricked. The sheriff put handcuffs on Ned and led him back to jail.</p>

            <p>A Fresh Start for Ned" Back with his faithful band of bandits, Ned tells them his plan. Fed up with jail, he is going to start afresh. He will join the gold rush and try his luck at prospecting for gold. If he gets lucky, he will return to help the inhabitants of Bond. Ned sells his horse and sets off on foot, with a handcart to hold his pick and shovel, swag, tent, metal pans, and cooking equipment. He meets lots of prospectors as he plods along the terrible roads and tracks that lead to the gold diggings. At Cariboo, Ned pays 38 shillings for a claim  for 38 days. Panning for gold. Ignoring the flies and the hot sun, Ned works from dawn to dusk, determined to find, not just gold dust, but a big gold nugget: a nugget he can sell for lots of cash. As he works, Ned mutters to himself, "Loosen the gravel andsand on the creek bed with the pick, dip the pan in the water and fill it with sand and gravel, shake the pan to sort the gold from the gravel and sand. Let mud and silt float up and out of the gold pan. Drain off the water and check the gravel for gold. Then start again. Loosen the ..." At night, when it is cold, Ned sleeps in his tent. When it is hot, he lies under the stars in his swag. When he sleeps, Ned dreams of finding a big nugget of gold. And then it happens. Sick and sad, his last shilling spent, Ned tries a new spot at the bend in the creek. He dips in his gold pan and as he is checking the gravel, he sees a glint of metal. Ned has found a big nugget of gold. He is rich. He can go back to Bond and join the gang. Tom, Pip and Sam are waiting when Ned gets off the train in Bond. That night they discuss how to make amends for their bad deeds.</p>

He explains to them that it is time to make amends for their bad deeds and asks them how they can help the men they tried to rob. "Well," say Tom, Pip and Sam as they begin to talk at the same time. "One at a time," says Ned. "Tom can start." "Fred, the jailer, has a sick horse and cannot afford the vet's fees," says Tom. "Mr Bog, at the bank, is old and frail and cannot afford the train ticket to visit his children and grandchildren," says Pip. "The coach, whose occupants we tried to rob, needs a new setof wheels, and the farmer, whose chickens were stolen, needs to be paid back," says Sam. Ned, Pip, Sam and Tom spend the next week carrying out the plan, in secret. The vet finds a ten pound note in his mail box to attend to thejailer's horse. Mr. Bog gets a train ticket in the mail. The coach driver finds a set of wheels resting against his shed and the farmer discovers he has ten extra chickens, when he counts his stock.

            <p>Jarra goes into the supermarket. There is not much on the shopping list so he picks up a basket from the stack. Jarra gets the pack of butter and a carton of milk off the shelf. Mum said ten plums is about 1 kilogram. He counts the plums. The packet of mints is on the shelf with the sweets. Jarra is tempted by the Smarties but mum said no extras. He just gets the mints. Jarra selects a bunch of cress. There is just the dog food left on the list. Jarra spots the cans of dog food and picks 2 cans: beef and chicken chunks. Jarra goes to the checkout and waits. He puts the shopping on the bench and checks his list. Butter, milk, plums, mints, cress, 2 cans of dog food. "That will be fifteen dollars and twenty cents," said the shopkeeper. "Will you need a bag?" "No thanks," replied Jarra, remembering the bags he had left on the hook on the kitchen door. "I"ll be OK" . Jarra paid the shopkeeper fifteen dollars and twenty cents and was given the docket. What do you think Jarra did with the shopping without a bag" What would you do" He tried the bag of plums in his hood but it did not fit. He tucked the carton of milk under his arm and put the pack of butter in the pocket of his jumper. He collected the rest of the goods and held them in his hands: plums, 2 cans of dog food, cress, bag of mints.</p>

Can you see Darwin and Fogg Dam on the map" A boat trip is the best way to see crocodiles, as they swim up to the boat for food and can be seen sitting on the river banks. Crocodiles jump up in the air to get at the food. There are 3000 crocodiles living by the river. This is a shot of a croc soaking up the sun in the mud. After the boat trip, Bob visited a crocodile farm. He saw thousands of crocodiles. Some were in pens and some were in billabongs. This is the pen where the young crocs hatch out from their eggs. In 24 weeks, they will be adult crocodiles. Crocodiles are farmed for their skins and their meat. The skins are used to make products such as handbags, hats, hat-bands and belts. Crocodile is a popular meat that is eaten in Australia and overseas. It tastes a bit like chicken. Bob got his wish and has lots of shots of crocodiles.

            <title>Dogs are Better than Cats </title>
            <p>I have lived with dogs and cats and I strongly believe that dogs are much better pets than cats. For a start, dogs are friendly animals. They are always happy to see you and they are good company. Dogs like people. Cats don"t. You can have fun with a dog in the house, in the backyard or in the park. Dogs will run with you, fetch a ball or stick, and can catch a Frisbee. As well as being good fun, this helps you and the dog keep fit. Cats are not much fun at all. The fact that dogs are reliable is important. They look after your home. Even when they seem to be asleep, they are listening for unusual sounds and bark if they think there is danger. Cats just leave your yard and roam the sterets. This is not much help at all. Did you know that domestic cats are killers" They often catch small animals, such as rats and chickens and bring them into the house. How would you feel if you went in your bedroom and found a mangled rodent on the bed" Dogs never do such horrible things. The best thing about dogs is that they are loyal. They wag their tails when they see you, and still love you, even if you step on them by mistake, or give them a bath when they do not want one. You must agree that dogs make better pets than cats. Dogs are fun. They helpyou keep fit. They stop you feeling lonely, protect your house and don"t wander off or kill small animals. The best thing about dogs is that they will love you and be your faithful friend to the end.</p>

            <title>Fire and the Caveman </title>
            <p>Fire has been an important element in the life of men from the caveman times. The caveman made use of fire to keep the entry of his cave safe from wild animals. The caveman rubbed sticks together on stone or a block of wood until it was very hot and it started to spark. The caveman then kept rubbing the sticks, adding fine leaf matter, bark and wood chips until the fibres ignited with a flame and the fire was struck. It was important for the caveman to find wood that didn"t smoke too much. A torch lit with fire could help a caveman establish if an approaching person was a tribe member or an enemy. The caveman collected meat and vegetables to eat. He used the embers of the fire, to cook them. Fire safety is important. The caveman dug a hole for the fire and used stones to stop the wind. This also confined the embers in the fireplace so a wildfire would not start. In winter and at night the fire helped stop the caveman feeling cold. Would men have survived without fire"</p>

            <p>Text written by Sandy Russo and illustrated by Dick Weigall Jake is a keen bee keeper who strives to produce the best honey in the state of Queensland. The bees live in hives at the bottom of Jake's garden. The children next door know they must keep away when they see Jake in his bee keeping outfit. One day, the children ask Jake to tell them about his bees and how they make honey. Jake explains that all the bees in the colony work together for the good of the hive. Each has a job to do. A hive has one queen. Her job is to lay eggs. Drones are larger than workers, but smaller than queen honey bees. The drones are male and their sole job is to mate with the queen bee. After mating, they die. In autumn or winter, the drones are driven out of the hive to minimize the number of bees that need to be fed, when food is scarce. Worker bees live for about 6 weeks. It is their job to maintain and operate the hive. They perform a range of tasks which change as they get older. They clean the hive2 care for the baby bees, the drones and the queen2 repair and build new wax combs2 regulate the temperature inside the beehive2 defend the hive and forage for pollen, nectar and water. When they get back to the hive, they make the nectar into honey, to use as food, and store it in the honeycomb. Jake tells the children that he only keeps native bees in his bee hives. Jake shows the children a honeycomb and invites them to taste the honey. Jorji shows the children her bee hive. Jorji thought it important to show that women have bees too!</p>

            <title>Smokey the Kitten</title>
            <p>We were very sad. A long black snake had bitten our cat. The vet gave him anti-venom but he still died. Our house was very boring without a cat. We had to get a new cat to stop us being sad. We rang about an ad in the paper. "Ragdoll kittens for sale."  They still had three left. We went to look. It was very hard to make up our mind. We came home with a little grey and white kitten. He was just twelve weeks old. When we got home we let him out of his travel box. We took him to the litter tray so he could go to the toilet. He set off to explore the house and we sat down to think of a name. Smokey is very quick. He hides and jumps out at us. Soccer with a ping pong ball is his best game. Catching the mouse in his plastic toy is fun. Smokey has his chores. He helps to feed the fish in the morning. Next he helps with the emails. His spelling is not good and he jumps on the wrong letters. He has good fun catching things on the screen. Next he helps make the beds and likes to hide under the quilt. Sweeping the floor is fun and he likes to ride on the broom. He runs quickly when he sees his dish go down on the tiles. He gobbles up his dinner and looks for more. He is a guts!  When we have coffee Smokey has a puss-a-chino! Smokey has a cat tere. It is a long jump for his little legs so he takes a running jump to get up. Scratching the post is good fun. If he plays too hard he falls off. Swinging on the rope is tricky. At the end of the day he stertches out by the Tv. He goes to sleep in his bed at the bottom of his tere. By morning he has made his way to my bed. He gets lonely in the dark.</p>

            <title>Sounds in the Attic </title>
            <p>Granny, Mum's mum, lived in a big, old house in the north of Scotland where winters are freezing cold and it gets dark before 4 pm on the shortest day. Mum used to tell us about her life as a child in the old house with its five floors and the big attic under the roof where Granny kept trunks of clothes that Mum and her friends  sed for dress-ups. She told us that when there was a storm, the roof tiles rattled, the wind moaned and the rain pelted against the glass. Sometimes, the power went off and the family huddled around a log fire, using torches and candles to see. It sounded quite spooky. We liked Mum's stories about life in the big house. We particularly liked her tales of the ghost that lived in the attic. Mum said she had seen the ghost when she was a child. It was an old lady whose dress trailed behind her as she shuffled across the floor. Mum and her sister had named the ghost, Elizabeth. It was the middle of winter when Granny died and Mum took my sister, Penny and me to Scotland for the funeral, and to pack up the contents of the house. Mum spent her time filling boxes with Granny's belongings while we explored the big house and its grounds. At bedtime on the first evening, Penny and I huddled around Mum on Granny's big bed while she told us ghost stories. That night, Penny and I heard noises in the attic. The next morning, we told Mum. "Could it be Elizabeth?" we asked, not sure if we hoped the reply would be "Yes" or "No". Mum smiled. "I don"t think so," she replied. But we were not satisfied. The next evening, Penny and I set the alarm clock for 1 am and when it went off, we tiptoed to the attic door, torches in hand. Together, we dragged down the ladder and went up the steps. As soon as we opened the hatch, we became aware of a horrible smell and, in the light of the torches, we saw animal droppings and babies in a nest. Then we understood. The shuffling sound was not a ghost. It was rats. We quickly closed the hatch and went back to bed. Seemingly, Granny had not been aware of the family of rats that had made its home in her attic. But it looked as if they had been there for a long time!</p>

            <title>Trapped in a Disused Mine </title>
            <p>Chad and Sam often visited the old gold mine with their dog, Tiger, a friendly, black labrador. They took picks and spades to help them find a gold nugget that they were sure would make them a fortune. While they were fossicking about, there was a rumble in the tunnel. Tiger began to bark and dashed out of the mine as rocks began tumbling onto the ground blocking the entry. It was dark and dusty and Chad's torch provided only a small glimmer of light. As the rocks settled, Chad stood up. He was shaken but unscathed. Sam was moaning in agony. His leg was trapped under a big rock. Using his spade as a lever, Chad carefully pushed the rock off Sam's leg and onto the ground. The boys used the torch to look around but they could see no escape. They were stuck and they had not told anyone where they were going. What could they do" It was unlikely that someone would be just outside the mine to hear them if they shouted. Sam groaned. He was scared. Then, they heard a noise outside. A dog was barking and men were shouting their names. They shouted back. At last a small shaft of sunshine penetrated the mine, as rocks were shifted to make a path to the outside. Then Tiger poked his nose through the gap that had been made between the rocks. Not long after, Chad's dad and Sam's dad stepped into the mine. Were they angry" No, they weren"t angry. They had been worried about the boys but they couldn"t be too cross. After all, it was not that long ago that they had fossicked in the mine, themselves. In fact, it was the boys" fathers who had taken them to see the mine not long before and told them a story about the gold nugget they had found when tahey were their age.</p>

            <title>Did Pedro Visit Alberto" </title>
            <p>On this particular morning, Pedro got up with the sun, scoffed his breakfast and ran out the door, shouting behind him that he was off to see Alberto. Mum yelled, "It's too early to visit friends!" But Pedro was out of earshot. He was on his way " across the plaza, past the church" and was nearly around the arena when he saw a ripple of red cloth above the wall. He stopped in his tracks, then took three steps back to get a better look. His eyes darted around the top of the wall. There it was again, almost out of sight. If only he could get a better view. Pedro scanned the outer wall of the arena and saw some jutting stones that he might be able to use as steps. He looked over his shoulder to see if anyone was watching, but there was no-one in sight. The "steps" were easy as his feet were little, but it was hard to find good hand holds. At last he reached the top of the wall and looked down on the arena. He could see it all. But he was disappointed. There was no matador and no bull. He was hoping madly that the red cloth had been real and not a trick of the morning light. The minutes passed. He looked around. Still no-one seemed to have seen him. "Snort." Pedro turned back to the arena and there it was " a huge bull. And then the matador entered the arena waving his red cloak. Pedro watched the man and marvelled at his skill. He believed he could stay all day and not get bored. As the sun came round to Pedro's side of the arena, it beat down on the back of his neck. The matador quickly looked up and made eye contact with Pedro. It nearly cost him his life. The bull's horn must have missed his side by millimeters. Pedro gasped and his eyes almost popped out of their sockets. The matador did not look at him again but worked until the sweat was pouring down his face. Then, without warning, the matador ran out of the arena and was gone. Pedro was sad that it had ended so suddenly. Before climbing down, he gazed into the arena, dreaming of being a matador when he got older. He was imagining the cheering of the crowd as they watched Pedro, the grand matador, when he heard, "Hey, kid!" This snapped him back to the present and, scared that he was about to be told off, Pedro turned timidly to face the voice. Pedro nearly fell. The voice was coming from the matador, who was still dressed in his garb and smiling up at him. Pedro quickly jumped down to say hello. Alberto  told Pedro that he had seen hisshadow in the sand and that was what made him look up. And then he invited Pedro and his family to his next fight as his personal guests. Pedro ran home, grinning from ear to ear. "How is Alberto?" asked his Mum. "He's very brave," replied Pedro.</p>

At the sailing club, I put on my sailing gear and a life jacket and smear sunscreen on my skin. Then I seek out Adam who looks after the boats. He tells me to take Quick Silver, a topper tied to a pontoon. I clamber in, pull on the main sheet to raise the sail and sit on the bench at the stern. Adam unties the painter, tosses it into the boat and pushes the boat out with his foot. I"m off, the main sheet in one hand and the tiller in the other. The sail fills and the boat speeds into the main channel of the river. "I love sailing so much." I feel the wind in my hair and on my cheeks and bask in the feeling of freedom.</p>

            <title>Birds in the Roof </title>
            <p>There are birds in our roof. I can hear them scratching about, particularly early in the mornings and in the early evening. I think they are starlings. They have been there before, and they are rebuilding their nest. In the mornings they come with thin twigs in their beaks and scuttle along the gutter. One day I got the step ladder and poked my head inside the manhole in the ceiling. I could hear chirping. How do birds get in the roof" Jeff, a gutter-man, came to have a look the other day and said there seemed to be a hole just under the roof line, but he wasn"t sure. So I climbed up a ladder one afternoon and saw two adults land on the gutter with food in their mouths. I watched. The starlings saw me. They didn"t seem to like being looked at. But after a minute, one of them couldn"t wait any longer, and it popped into the roof, exactly where Jeff thought there was a hole. I told Jeff we would need some gutter guard to stop this happening again. But I didn"t want the birds and chicks trapped inside, so I said we would wait till the chicks had left the nest. A few days later there was a terrible commotion. The chicks were learning to fly. It's a long way down and they must have been very scared as they tried out their wings for the first time. Anyway, there was nothing on the ground, like a dead chick, so I guess they all made it OK. A few days later, Jeff came and installed the gutter-guard. But the starlings come back everyday and perch on the mesh. They don"t understand why they can"t get into the roof to rebuild their nest. One bird was so desperate it came down the chimney and I had to let it out through the front door.</p>

            <title>Dirty Dean </title>
            <p>May I tell you a story, please-About a pirate who travelled the seven seas, About a ship, that battled a mighty breeze, And the pirate's cat, that was Siamese. This is what happened, I"ll set the scene: He was the scariest pirate there's ever been. His hair was smelly and his teeth were green-And he went by the name of Dirty Dean. The ship would sail by day and night, And Dean would never have to fight. He was such a revolting sight, That all the other pirates ran away in fright! The Scurvy Dogs were his hand-picked crew, And those dogs all knew what to do. They ate fish stew and learned kung fu From the captain's cat, whose name was Boo. Through latitude and longitude They acted crude, they acted rude. Their odour had an attitude: It wasn"t very pleasant, dude. But something changed for Dirty Dean, Who"d always had the worst hygiene. He"d never washed, was never clean, A toothbrush he had never seen. It was a dark and stormy night. A hurricane of awesome might Turned the ship into a kite, And Dirty Dean went for a flight. The Scurvy Dogs abandoned ship. And Boo and Dean went on a trip. They felt the boat beneath them tip And then it did a double flip. The storm it blew, the ship it flew, And Dean and Boo, the next they knew, Were washed ashore without a clue Of what they were supposed to do. But on the white and sandy beach An island girl, whose name was Peach, Stepped up to them and made a speech, And handed them an apple each. And even though he wasn"t sure,  Peel and core he ate it raw. It tasted good. He wanted more. Could it be true, could this be real" She then produced a fruity meal. He ate it all with fevered zeal. He even ate the orange peel! Peach knew that Dean, enjoyed the fruit, And even in his pirate suit, She thought that he was not a brute. In fact she found him kind of cute. But when she saw his teeth were green, And then she caught a whiff of Dean  She knew she had to get him clean!</p>

It crossed rivers and went in tunnels. In Scotland they saw lots of old houses and shops. The houses were black. They looked drab and dark. Lots of houses did not have a garden. They had no spot for the kids to run and play. The kids had to go to the park or stay in the house. In Scotland, they have buses with a top deck and a bottom deck. It is fun to sit on top. You can see a lot from the top of the bus. The traditional dress of men and boys in Scotland is the kilt. Their legs must get cold in winter.

They had not been taken by a fox or the cat from the farm. They were safe. Gran smiled.</p>

            <title>Huntsman Spider Versus Jumping Jack Ant </title>
            <p>Huntsman spiders have long, hairy legs and can move very fast. They have 8 eyes. Some huntsmen are as big as an adult's hand. Unlike most spiders, huntsmen don"t spin webs. Sometimes, they come into houses and sit on walls and ceilings, waiting. What are they waiting for" Huntsman spiders eat cockroaches, earwigs and other bugs, sometimes other spiders. When a bug gets close, they grab it and inject it with poison to liquidise its insides. Later they will drink the liquid. In the rainforest, there is a huntsman that has a grey or brown back and a green belly, so it blends perfectly with the teres on which it lives. Harry is one of these huntsmen. Small jumping jack ants also live in the rainforest. They have sharp mandibles and a sting in their tail that can deliver powerful venom. They are very agile and can jump from branch to branch. They are quite fearless. One day Jenny, a jumping jack ant, spots Harry. Jenny normally eats nectar from flowers but when she sees Harry, she thinks he will make a good meal for the larvae in the nest. She jumps onto the spider. Harry grabs the ant and sinks in his fangs. But before she dies, Jenny stings the huntsman, partly paralysing it with her venom. Jumping jack ants at the nest hear the noise and run to help. The ants work as a team, attacking the spider from all sides. Within seconds, Harry is dead and the ants drag his lifeless body to their underground nest to provide food for the larvae. In the world of ants and spiders, ants in the large numbers will always win.</p>

            <p>Mirtle lives on a ranch in Australia with a bunch of camels. Mirtle is sad. She thinks she is odd. All the camels have a hump. But Mirtle's back is flat. "How can I get a hump?" she asks the ants. The ants offer to make an anthill on her back. Mirtle settles down on the sand and the ants build an anthill on her back. But, the moment Mirtle stands up, the anthill slips off. Mirtle feels awful. She weeps and the ants attempt to cheer her up. But to no avail. "Perhaps if I drink a lot, I will grow a hump on my back," thinks Mirtle. They say camels keep water in their humps. Mirtle drinks lots and lots of water but still she has no hump. Mirtle grows sadder and sadder. The rest of the camels tell her she is OK. She is different, but she is OK. Then, one morning, the owner turns up with an animal that has no hump. It looks like Mirtle. "Perhaps I"m not so odd," thinks Mirtle. "Here is another camel without a hump." Mirtle runs up to the animal and nuzzles it. "I am so happy to see you," she hums. "I thought I was odd. But now, I am not the only camel without a hump." Mick , the new arrival, grins. "You are not odd," he replies . "You are just not a camel. Like me , you are an alpaca."

            <title>The Lost Cave </title>
            <p>Hidden deep in the dense jungle that covers the mountains of central Vietnam, lies the biggest cave on the planet. It is so big, its main cavern could fit an entire steret of skyscrapers with 40 floors. The cave was found by chance. Ho, a local boy, was scrambling among the rocks looking for aloe, when he rested against a big rock. He felt a cold breeze and heard the distant rush of an underground river. He went behind the rock. It was pitch black but he felt he was entering a space that was very big. Ho had found the entrance to a vast cave. But the cave was so well hidden that Ho was unable to find it again. Years later, a group of cave experts asked Ho to take them to the cave. But still he could not find it. Ho felt foolish. In 2009, 20 years after he found the cave, Ho set out again, alone, intent on proving that his lost cave existed. This time he found the rock, heard the water and felt the breeze. Yes, he had found the lost cave. Ho had found the biggest cave in the world. The cave is enormous! 100 meters wide, 280 meters high and 4 kilometers long. Its name is Hang Son Doong or Mountain River Cave.</p>

            <title>The Raft 2 </title>
            <p>Tim and Jack, and the two dogs, set off on their homemade raft. As they have no way to steer or propel the craft, they let it drift with the current. They are having their lunch, when they feel a bump and are thrust forward as the raft abruptly comes to a stop. They have drifted into shallow water and gone aground. The raft is stuck on a sand bar. The boys jump off the raft, quickly followed by the dogs. With less weight, the raft rises enough to allow the boys to gently push it off the sand bar and into deeper water. Tim and Jack decide that it is time to go home. They harness the dogs to the front of the raft. As the dogs drag the raft from the front, the boys, waist deep in water, push the raft from behind. Their plans may have been thwarted today but as they wade through the water, the boys plan their next trip. What do you think the boys are planning to do on their next trip" Next time, the boys will have paddles to propel and steer the raft, a tent and sleeping bags.</p>

            <title>The Raft 3 </title>
            <p>Today is the day Tim and Jack have been waiting for. The raft is stocked with food, sleeping bags and a tent and the boys are ready for adventure. Mum and Dad help launch the home-made raft and, this time, they have long paddles to steer it with and propel it along. The boys fish as the raft is carried gently down the river by the current. They avoid the shallow water where they went aground last time and, as the sun begins to set, they head for the sheltered cove they spotted on their last trip. Carefully, they drag the raft onto the beach and set up camp. They make a fire, cook dinner and then snuggle into their sleeping bags with the dogs at their feet. What the boys do not know is that there are robbers nearby who have been watching them. In the night, the robbers steal the raft and set off down the river. But the dogs hear them. They begin to bark and demand to be let out of the tent. The boys follow the dogs and, in the light of the full moon, they see the raft disappear as it rounds a bend in the river. Tim and Jack, with the dogs at their heels, take a shortcut. The dogs run into the water, barking, and swim to the raft. As the dogs grab a rope each and begin to drag the raft back to shore, the robbers lose their balance and topple into the water. The robbers were outwitted this time, but the boys have not seen the last of them.</p>

            <title>The Raft </title>
            <p>This is the raft that Tim and Jack constructed with a little help from Dad. They found most of the things they needed at the dump: lengths of wood and plastic drums for the raft itself, discarded bus seats to sit on, old pipes to support the roof and a wood-fired stove, complete with flue, for cooking. Back in Dad's shed, they made the frame and attached the plastic drums. A tin roof protected the raft from rain and sun and provided a shelf for extra chairs and the logs of wood needed to fuel the stove. With help from Mum and Dad, the boys lifted the raft onto Dad's trailer and dragged it to the dam. They launched the raft and then Mum and Dad left the boys to it. Along with the dogs, Tim and Jack were all set for an adventure. But were they" Tim and Jack had a problem. What do you think the problem was" Tim and Jack had no means of propelling the raft along: no paddles, no motor, no punting pole, and no way of steering it.</p>

            <title>A Trip to Antarctica </title>
            <p>Have you ever wished you could visit Antarctica" I did, and I was lucky. My wish came true. I went by ship from South America. It took two days. The sea was quite calm with no big waves. Sometimes it is choppy and people get sea sick. The ship I went on was MV Explorer. Most people just called it "The Little Red Ship"."The Little Red Ship" could only carry 108 passengers. This meant that we could all get off the ship quickly, each time it got to land. We saw masses of ice and snow and there were many animals and birds to look at. Every day we landed at a new place. We went ashore in little rubber boats, called zodiacs. They were great fun. Each time we went ashore, we took lots of food, tents and safety equipment in case the ship sank while we were on land. Antarctica is a scary place and you would not live long, without food and shelter, if the ship sank. The icebergs were huge and had very odd shapes. Most of them were much, much bigger than "The Little Red Ship." We felt very small whenever we got near them. A ship must not go too close. An iceberg can roll over on top of you and sink your ship or zodiac. One day we went way down south to the Weddell Sea. The sea was all ice."The Little Red Ship" had to cut a track through the ice. We all stood at the bow of the ship as it cracked the ice. What would we do if the ice froze again and locked us in" At last, the captain stopped the ship. Members of the crew tested the ice to make sure it was thick and then we all got off. We did not need a little rubber boat, that day. We just climbed down the ladder. A penguin came across to see us. We were told to lie down on the ice so we did not scare it. Don"t we look stupid lying on the ice! The penguin was not scared of us so we stood up and took photos. Wow! What a trip! I will never forget it.</p>

            <title>A Visit to the Fair </title>
            <p>Phil and I are mates. Last Saturday, the pair of us decided to go to the fair. When we got there, Phil dared me to go on a ride that went high into the air. I was scared but I tried not to show it. Up the stairs I went. I got into the chair and did up the belt. A hooter blared and we were off. I was so scared my hair stood on end. I could hardly bear it. I gripped the bar and stared ahead, trying to be brave. At last the ride came to an end and I got off smiling, my hand outstertched waiting for my dare money from Phil. Next we went to sideshow alley. Phil was attracted to the Wild West Archery Stall where a man, wearing a cowboy outfit, was tearing tickets from a big roll and handing them out to contestants. Phil paid for a ticket and was handed a bow and three arrows. With the third arrow, he hit thebull's eye, which meant he could choose a prize. There were large cuddly bears and pandas, fancy dress hats and a square wooden box with tennis balls inside. But what attracted Phil was a funny wig made with purple hair displayed on a life sized foam model. He put on the wig and I glared at him because he looked so silly. But Phil just grinned. Off we went, Phil in his purple wig and me still glaring angrily and pretending I didn"t know him. However, I couldn"t resist a photograph! Finally, we went to the coconut shy to try to win a coconut. I went firstand missed every time. Then it was Phil's turn. He obviously had a flair for it because he knocked a coconut onto the ground with his first ball. When we got home, we cracked open the coconut and shared it.</p>

            <title>An African Elephant </title>
            <p>Safari The African bush elephant is the largest living land animal. They can grow as tall as 4 meters. They are very strong and you may be in danger if you do not take care. Elephants are also very intelligent. Their brain is larger than any other land animal. They can feel grief, use tools and remember things. Africa can get very hot and dry. Elephants have some tricks to help them stay cool. They have large flat ears which let a lot of heat out of their body. They can flap the ears like a fan to make a cool breeze. They squirt water on their body like a shower. They roll in the mud and let it dry on their body. The mud keeps them cool and stops them getting sunburnt. It also stops the insects from biting them. Elephants love to swim and they can submerge for a long time. They use their trunk like a snorkel so they can get air. Sometimes they will stay in the river all day. If they are hungry they find weeds to eat. One day when we were out spotting elephants our land rover got a flat tyre right by the elephants. The driver had to get out to change the tyre. He said, "Yell if they come this way." We had to keep guard while the guide changed the tyre. If the elephant got scared he might charge us and kill the driver and tip the land rover over. Look hard at the photograph and you can see the elephant. Elephants use their trunks and tusks to tear at leaves, bark and tere trunks. They eat a huge amount of food every day. Sometimes they just tear out the tere by the roots. They do not leave much for the rest of the animals to eat. Elephants live in a family. A family has about ten females with their calves. The male elephants live in a different family by themselves. When the boy calves are big they go to live with the men. If one mother gets sick or dies this way there are lots of mothers to look after the baby. Elephants are protected. Poachers try to kill them and steal their ivory tusks. The ivory is worth a lot. Both male and female elephants have tusks so poachers kill both. The tusks can grow up to 2 meters long. It was a privilege to go on an African Elephant Safari. I was lucky to have the chance ride an elephant and later to photograph a wild elephant in the bush.</p>

            <title>Charlie the Cockroach's Revenge </title>
            <p>Charlie couldn"t believe what had happened to Clarissa, his mother. One minute she seemed so big and strong, so speedy, so beautiful and reliable. Then, suddenly, the man of the house had turned on the light and spotted Mum. In spite of being able to change direction 2 times every second, thanks to the many knees on her legs, she was stamped on and squashed-splat-on the kitchen floor! Then the man filled glasses with water from the tap, carried them from the kitchen and turned out the light. Charlie knew, from his mother's lessons on how to find food in the dark, that the man and woman, whose kitchen he lived in, spent the night sleeping in the room next door. He also knew that sometimes they ate pizza, or bars of chocolate, in bed and left scraps of food on the floor and on the pillows. Chocolate was Charlie's favourite food. Every night, the man and the woman had two glasses of water each on a table beside their bed. Charlie and his brothers and sisters sometimes drank from the glasses. They even swam in the water on hot nights, just for fun. There were scary moments when the man or woman reached out to take a sip and they had to get out quickly to avoid being swallowed! Charlie shared his plan with his sisters and brothers. Each of them was to carry a part of their mother's remains into the bedroom. Cockroaches are surprisingly strong and sometimes carry up to their own weight. Charlie had told them not to eat any of the parts. Cockroaches are prepared to eat anything. They even eat other roaches at times!  But they did what Charlie told them and really weren"t very hungry after seeing their mother's death. Slowly, parts of Clarissa's crushed body parts were dropped into the four glasses. Pieces of head, brain, eyes, gut, heart, wings, bits of legs and antennae swelled in the water. When the man and the woman woke up next morning, they both felt sick when they realised that the water they had been drinking in the night contained bits of cockroach!  They felt  ven worse when they saw that the glasses, in which they had been soaking their false teeth, also had bits of cockroach floating in the water! In fact, they never really got over feeling sick whenever they saw a glass of water! They could not forget the sight of floating cockroach body parts the morning after Clarissa died. </p>

            <title>Charlie's Story </title>
            <p>My name is Charlie. Two months ago there were two rabbits and a cat in our family. Now, all we have is a cat. Fluffy died first and Jerry died one month later. I thought Jerry might have died because he missed Fluffy's company but Mum thinks he was unwell. When I saw Fluffy lying oddly, I thought something was wrong and I tickled her with a straw under her nose. But she didn"t move. It was strange that she didn"t respond. Jerry was sitting next to her as if hewanted to protect her. Our rabbits lived in a hutch in our house. I looked after them. I loved them and fed them and spoilt them rotten. When Fluffy and Jerry were let out of their cage, they jumped around the house. Fluffy hid under the table and Jerry hid under my bicycle. They ate fruit and vegetables and we gave them terats, like strawberries and grapes. They had funny habits. They liked to jump onto the couch and then onto a chair and from the chair onto the table. One day, Jerry took a banana off the plate on the table and ate it, skin and all. Another day, he bit through the electricity cords. Jerry made me laugh. He and the cat used to chase each other over the back of the couch. We buried the rabbits under the pear tere, wrapped in white cloths. Mum and Dad dug the hole. I do miss the rabbits, especially Jerry who was my favourite. I miss their company, and I especially miss the cuddles. Mum has drawn a picture showing the rabbits racing freely through the fields with praying mantis on their backs, just as I imagine them.</p>

            <title>Clarissa the Cockroach Dies </title>
            <p>The death of Canny Clarissa the Cockroach is well known among cockroaches but what followed has gone down in cockroach history. Before leaving her home under the fridge on her final forage to find food in the dark kitchen, Clarissa had checked that her brood of baby cockroaches -known as nymphs -were safe. Forty nymphs hatched from her last batch of eggs, but already ten of them had been eaten by house spiders, leaving only thirty alive! This is why cockroaches sleep secretly during the day when their spider enemies are out and about. The nymphs had grown to be nearly 2 centimeters long, compared to Clarissa's 3 centimeters. They were almost ready to leave their cosy nest to fend for themselves. They waited, peering out from under the warm fridge, for Mum to return with food to share with her children. Suddenly, the kitchen was flooded with bright light as the man of the house turned on the switch. The nymphs watched as Clarissa dropped the scrap of cat food she was carrying and raced across the kitchen floor towards the safety of home. They had no worries. They knew their Mum was canny and quick. Thanks to six legs, each with a number of knees, she was able to change direction more than 2 times every second. "Come on Mum!" they hissed in almost silent cockroach language. "You can make it!" Wrong! A big brown Ugg boot stamped on their mother, squashing her flat! Splat!  Only inches from safety! They stared at Mum's splattered remains in shocked horror, while the man of the house filled some glasses with water at the sink. Then darkness descended as he switched off the light and left the room. "Right!" said Charlie Cockroach to his brothers and sisters. Charlie was the eldest, and the canniest, ofClarissa's nymphs. "We must take revenge for the murder of our mother! I have an idea of what we can do!"</p>

            <title>Clarissa the Cockroach </title>
            <p>Clarissa is a very big female cockroach, about three centimeters long. She spends all day under the fridge, squeezed up in a narrow crack in the concrete. It's nice and warm, thanks to the heat emitted by the fridge motor. This suits her just fine. And she likes the dark. Now and then, a morsel of food rolls under the fridge and she grabs it. Just one pea can keep her going for several days. Clarissa sometimes attracts male cockroaches and they spend a bit of time together. After that, she lays a bunch of eggs that hatch into baby cockroaches, called nymphs. Clarissa and her babies live together under the fridge until the babies grow up  and go off to find their own homes. One night, Clarissa felt a bit peckish and went out looking for food. You never know what people might leave lying about on the kitchen bench. They also drop crumbs and stuff from the bench top or dining table onto the floor. When there isn"t much on the floor or bench tops, there are the cats" bowls. Being such fussy eaters, cats tend to leave food scraps behind, and there is always water in their bowl. This evening, while she is out on the prowl, the light suddenly comes on and the master of the house appears. Uh oh!  Clarissa is in danger. She makes a quick dash for cover. And I mean quick. She can travel at nearly a meter a second, on her six spiny legs. But she is not quick enough. He spots her. He raises his foot and brings his boot rightdown on top of her. Squelch and it's all over for Clarissa, thecockroach!</p>

            <title>Dung Beetles </title>
            <p>Dung beetles eat dung. What is dung" Dung is poo! There are dung beetles that live everywhere except Antarctica. This might sound like a very bad job to have but it is very important. It recycles waste, stops sickness from germs from the poo and takes seeds to different places. There are many different types of dung beetles. Most of them are black and shiny. They are very strong and can roll a ball of dung which is 25 times as heavy as they are. Dung beetles are insects and have six legs and wings. Some dung beetles ride on the animals they eat the dung from. When the animal drops some dung the beetles hop off and collect the dung. Other dung beetles have a very strong sense of smell and just sniff out the dung they like. They roll some of the dung into a ball and start to roll it back to their tunnel to store it to eat later. Most dung beetles like the dung of herbivores "animals which eat plants, so there are lots of seeds in the dung. Sometimes they turn round and use their back legs to roll the ball if it gets stuck on something. They go in a line to the place they need to get to. If a big rock or hill is in the way they just go over it. One very big dung beetle can roll more than one thousand times its own weight. That is like a man tugging 12 buses full of people. This dung beetle is digging a hole to put his dung ball in. They have to be very quick to get the ball of dung hidden because some lazy dung beetles try to rob dung balls so they do not have to make their own. As well as using dung balls for food, they also lay their eggs in a dung ball. When dung beetles mate they roll a dung ball to the place they are going to hide it. They lay the eggs inside it. That way the baby dung beetles have lots of food when they hatch.</p>

            <title>Murder on the Tram </title>
            <p>A lady sits slumped in her seat, seemingly asleep. It is not until the tram arrives at the end of the line, and everyone is getting off, that a man approaches her and realises that she is not alive. He raises the alarm. While the driver shuts the door to keep the remaining passengers in the tram, the conductor runs to a telephone box and rings the police. Detective  Hunter takes the call. "Not another unusual deathon my patch!" he grumbles. "It's the second this month." Hunter jumps into his car with his young constable, Fox. On arrival at the tram terminus they inspect the body. Fox assumes that the lady has died of natural causes but Hunter spots a small red mark on her neck and disagrees. In her handbag, they find an envelope with her name, Mrs Landers, and address. Inside is a letter. The letter, from a Mr Rex Seligman, is a blackmail note demanding that Mrs Landers give him the jewellery she smuggled out of Germany, when she fled in 1936. A photograph is enclosed of Mrs Landers at a ball wearing a dazzling diamond necklace. There is a handsome man of a similar age, at her side. The meeting place is the Stag Hotel, Adelaide, at 5 pm on September 18th. "That's today," remarks Fox. Hunter and Fox interrogate the people from the tram but no-one reports anything unusual except a child who remembers the lady who had been sitting next to the victim and had got off the tram several stops earlier. He describes a middle aged lady wearing a black coat and hat. He had said hello to her and when she responded, he noticed an unusual accent. The body is taken to the lab where it is discovered that the old lady was poisoned, probably by a needle in the neck. So, who is the unknown woman who was sitting beside Mrs Landers for the first part of her tram trip" Hunter and Fox drive to Mrs Landers" house where they are met by thehousekeeper, an affable woman, who left Germany with Mrs Landers. She offers the men a cup of tea and freshly baked cake. She is disterssed to hear that her misterss has died and begins to sob. Hunter asks her to show them to hermisterss's bedroom. A jewellery box sits on the dressing table and when they open it, a beautiful diamond necklace is sitting inside. Mrs Green points to the photograph propped up beside it, the samephotograph as that in the envelope in Mrs Landers" bag. She explains thatthe man in the photo is Rex Seligman, the man who sent the blackmail note. "Wherewere you at 2 pm, today?" Hunter asks Mrs Green. "I"ve been in the house all afternoon," she replies. "I did some baking and was about to have a cup oftea whenyou arrived." As they leave, Hunter sees a black coat and hat on the hallstand. He looks at his watch. There is just enough time to get to The Stag by 5 pm. When Hunter and Fox enter the pub, they see the man in the photograph, sitting at a corner table. They ask if he is Rex Seligman and show him the blackmail note and photograph. "Wherewere you at 2 pm?" Hunter asks. "Here. You can ask the barman," he replies. The barman confirms his story. Although the man has an alibi, Hunter books him for attempted blackmail. With Seligman handcuffed in the back of the car, they head for Mrs Landers" house and park the car a little distance from the gate. As they enter the property, Hunter tells Fox to look in the bin. Fox is walking towards his boss, holding a discarded needle, when they see Mrs Green leaving the house. She is carrying an overnight bag. They stop her. "Where are you going, Mrs Green?" asks Hunter. "Hello, Mr Hunter," she replies, "I"m going to spend the night at my sister's. Mrs Landers" deathhas quite upsetme." "I think not," says Fox as he handcuffs her.Heopens the bag, rummages inside and then takes out a small package, containing a diamond necklace. "I"m arresting you for the murder of Mrs Landers and the theft of a very valuable necklace."</p>

            <title>The Last Trip of the Little Red Ship </title>
            <p>The Little Red Ship was its nickname. Its real name was MV Explorer and its job was to take tourists on trips to Antarctica. On 11th November, 2710 passengers and crew set off from South America for the trip of a lifetime. It was the trip of a lifetime! If it hadn"t been for the captain's skills everyone might have died. In the middle of the night, the ship hit an iceberg. It made a big gash in the hull which let water in. Some passengers reported a loud bang at the time of the impact, but others said they heard only the normal crunching of ice when you sail through icy waters. Much later, a man in a cabin on the bottom deck woke up to find sea water in his cabin. He told a member of the crew. Crew members found the gash in the hull. They tried to pump the water out but to no avail. A mayday call was put out by the ship and the captain sounded the alarm. He told everyone to put on thick clothes and life jackets. The crew put emergency packs in the zodiacs. Everyone got into the zodiacs. They did not know whether there was a ship close by to rescue them. Not many ships go to Antarctica. The Little Red Ship was sinking. She would make a big wave when she went down. The zodiacs kept well away from the ship so it did not suck them under when it sank. In the afternoon of the 23rd. November, the Little Red Ship began her last trip. It was a trip to the bottom of the sea. It was very sad. The passengers watched the ship sink from the zodiacs. They drifted for five hours before a ship came to rescue them. I think it is much better for the Little Red Ship to end her days as a home for fish under the ice than to be stripped for scrap metal when she got too old to sail. The crew members were very brave and the captain was wise to abandon ship when he did. It is a sad story but, in a way, it has a happy ending.</p>

            <title>The Stolen Statue </title>
            <p>Ben King is a private detective. His most recent assignment was to locate a valuable statue that had been stolen from an American collector. King's search took him to a remote cliff top cottage. He looked inside and saw three men standing around a large wooden crate. One of the men handed wads of dollars to the other two and then made a call on his mobile phone. The men sat down. They seemed to be waiting for something. King waited, too. He knew he could not take on three men on his own, but when one man left the room, he made his move. He entered the house and accosted the two men. Immediately, the third man returned. He aimed his gun at Ben and fired. King was winged. He staggered out of the house and fell to the ground. Then they heard a helicopter approach. The man with the gun staggered towards the helicopter with the crate. It looked as if he would get away. But King had a different plan. Despite the pain in his arm, he jumped into his car and drove towards the helicopter. Surely, King didn"t plan to crash the car into the helicopter. The man panicked. He dropped the crate and made a dash for the chopper. As King heard the engine start up, he rolled out of the car onto the ground and watched as it careered into the helicopter and burst into flames. King phoned for help. He picked up the gun, dropped by the thief when he let go of the crate, and strode towards the house. The two men gave themselves up and King held them at gun point until the police arrived.</p>

            <title>Zoos Should Be Abolished </title>
            <p>I strongly oppose the existence of zoos and think that they should be abolished. How can anyone, seeing a wild animal holed up, often on its own, in a cage, doubt that zoos are cruel" These animals have been robbed of their freedom and imprisoned for life. It is argued that zoos are educational because they allow the visitor to see animals they wouldn"t otherwise see. But what value is there in seeing a locked up animal in an artificial environment" It provides the onlooker with no sense of the life the animal would lead in its native habitat, how it finds or catches food or looks after its young. This is not educational. The animal's day is one of boredom, where everything around it is artificial: artificial ponds, artificial teres, and food served up by zoo keepers. Furthermore, many animals that would normally be part of a group are kept separated, with males frequently kept away from females, unless it is the mating season or a partner is shipped in from another zoo. I think this is unnatural, cruel and selfish. People say that thanks to zoos, we are protecting species. What for" So that they can become a rarity to be gawked at by the paying public" If a species is at risk, it is probably too late for protection. Nothing could have saved the dinosaur. Let bygones be bygones and let us focus our money and energy on maintaining the environments, all over the world, that are home to theworld's wildlife, rather than preserving the wildlife in environmentsthat are not their native habitat. We all know this is the right thing to do. If we want to preserve the memory of a species, we need photographs and film, research and books about it, specimens in museums, not a specimen in a zoo. Together, let us lobby governments to close down all zoos. Now is the time to abolish zoos, forever.</p>

            <title>A Glimpse into Deep Time </title>
            <p>Almost a hundred million years ago, when Australia was still joined to Antarctica, dinosaurs roamed the Queensland outback. Today, the terrain is open grassland with scattered pockets of scrub. In dinosaur days, it was pine forests, swamps and mudflats. In 1999, David Elliot was mustering sheep when he stumbled on a very big bone. It was the thigh bone of one of Australia's biggest dinosaurs, a 20-meter long sauropod. Three years later, Elliot found the mingled bones of the sauropod Matilda and Banjo, a carnivorous theropod. They had died together, stuck in a billabong. Banjo was a 5 meter long carnivore that looked like a cross between an emu and a goanna, with long, hook-like claws and sharp, serrated teeth. Matilda, a herbivore, was massive. She was about 15 meters long and 20 tonnes. Not far away, you can see the 33 inch footprints of about 150 dinosaurs. Their tracks record the day when a 5 tonne carnivore spooked a mob of smaller dinosaurs. The smaller dinosaurs ran for their lives across long-gone mudflats. The footprints, now set in stone, are a vivid reminder, not just that dinosaurs inhabited our land, but of a particular event, in deep time, that actually happened.</p>

            <title>Polar Bear Hunt </title>
            <p>We went all the way to the Arctic to see polar bears in the wild. We travelled on a little ship. Each day, we went hunting. Each day, we saw lots of interesting animals and birds, but no polar bears. When we got off the ship, we went hunting in rubber zodiacs or we paddled canoes. We did not hunt with guns. We hunted with cameras and binoculars. We looked high up on the cliffs. Alas! We saw no polar bears. Off we go again in our quest to find a polar bear. At last, high up on the cliffs, we see a dot. Is it a polar bear" Yes! Will he come down to the water" We must sit in our little boats and wait. Slowly the polar bear gets closer. He is dirty brown, not clean white. Then splash! He jumps into the water and swims across the bay. We follow him, very slowly. We must not make a sound. The polar bear is an expert hunter. It mostly eats seals. It is said that a polar bear can smell a seal up to 20 miles  away! When there are plenty of seals, adult polar bears just eat the fat as it provides a lot more energy. They leave the carcass for the scavengers, such as foxes and ravens. They also eat white whales and walruses as well as kelp , fish sea birds, and mussels. The polar bear is heading for land. He swims past the ducks. I think he is looking for something bigger today. The polar bear gets out of the water and shakes himself like a dog. We sit in the zodiac and watch him. It is fantastic to be so close. Polar bears spend about half their day hunting and for the rest of the time, they sleep and rest. We see the polar bear lie on the snow and have a nap. After a short time, he wakes up and rolls in the snow. He looks just like a big, cuddly puppy. The next day, we saw more polar bears. We saw them kill a seal and eat it. They did not look cuddly at all.</p>

            <title>The Catamaran </title>
            <p>It is hot and Dan and I set off for the beach. We sit on the sand and watch the people on the beach. A kid digs a pit with his dad and jumps in2 three kids kick a soccer ball2 a dog fetches a stick. But what interests us most are the catamarans. The catamarans are for rent at twenty dollars an hour. Dan and I have never been sailing before but it does not look hard. We decide to have a go. We put on life jackets, pay the man and push the catamaran out into the water until we are waist deep. Dan jumps onto the boat and then I join him. I take the tiller, the wooden stick you steer with, and the main sheet. Dan controls the jib. As we set sail, the wind gets up. The sail fills and soon we are speeding out to sea. I never thought a boat could be propelled so fast by the wind. I love the thrill as we skim across the water. I am not aware of the danger we are in until Dan shouts, "I think we should turn back." I attempt to turn the boat around but it continues out to sea. "I think you have to tack," yells Dan, fear in his voice. But I don"t knowhow to tack. Dan tries, but his skills are no better than mine. We panic. We tug on the sails. In the process, the catamaran tips and Dan and I end up in the water with the main sail on top of us. We swim out from under the sail. "I think there is a bit of string you pull to get the catamaran up," shouts Dan. He leans into the boat and grabs a rope and pulls. As if by magic, the catamaran rights itself. But I still cannot get the boat to turn round. As the catamarans on the sand become distant dots, we shout for help and wave our arms in the air. It is not long before two men from the catamaran rental reach us in a speedboat. They drop the sails and tie out painter to the stern of the speedboat. We feel foolish as we sit on the hull of the catamaran and get towed in. But we agree it was fun. Perhaps we should have some sailing lessons before we set sail again!</p>

            <title>Tig's Attempts at Camouflage </title>
            <p>Tig has realised that she can be seen from a long way off because of her white coat. This means that she is easily spotted when she is doing things her mum and dad don"t like. Tig plans to camouflage herself so she cannot be seen. Today, she experiments with wet sand. She reckons a thick coat of wet sand willbe good! "I"ll blend in quite well," she thinks. "I don"t think they"ll see me sniffing the horse poo!" Tig's next idea makes sense to her but not to us! Why is she mistaken" Tig digs a hole and sticks her nose in the ground. "You can"t see me now," thinks Tig, as she tries to dig out the ball she has found. Yes, we can. "But I can"t see you." "Mmmmm!" Next, Tig considers ways of covering herself so that she can roam unseen. There are different sorts of seaweed on the beach. Maybe she could disguise herself as a mound of seaweed. "Is it better to drape myself in the black seaweed or the tan seaweed with the bubbles?" she asks herself. Tig's next idea is interesting. This is her thinking. Maybe I can pretend to be a person. My mum and dad wear jackets and sit on settees. My mum and dad are people. If I have my jacket on and sit on a settee, then I will look like a person, too" Why is Tig's idea incorrect" Since Tig's ideas so far have not saved her from getting told off, shedecides that it might be better to try to blend into the natural environment. She looks for an environment that looks like her. Could you spot Tig against the white sand of the beach" "If I walk slowly and don"t look back, perhaps they won"t see me disappear into the cliffs." "Or I could blend in with the crowd. Which dog do you think is me in this photo?"</p>

            <title>When Kit Took a Tumble Yesterday, </title>
            <p>I took my dog, Kit, for a walk along the beach. The clouds partly hid the sun and the wind howled loudly. At first, Kit scampered happily amongst the rocks but then she disappeared. I called her name, louder and louder. Eventually, there was a soft whimper and she slowly made her way down the rocks and limped towards me. She slumped painfully to the ground at my feet. I lifted Kit and began to carry her home. She was very brave and silently put up with the pain. But gradually she got heavier and heavier until I could no longer hold her. Fortunately, a man drove into his drive just in front of us and I asked him if he would kindly drive Kit and me home. Kit and I sat awkwardly on the front seat, the seatbelt clipped tightly around us. When we got home, I drove Kit straight to the vet. The vet took an X-ray that showed that Kit had broken three ribs. It is likely that her ribs will never heal properly.</p>

            <title>An Off-Road Trip </title>
            <p>At last, Dave had saved up enough money to buy a second-hand 4-Wheel Drive so he could go off-road driving with his mates. For their first trip together, they decided to take the Oodnadatta Track in the north of South Australia. Their destination was Lake Eyre. Lake Eyre had a big filling in 2010 and Dave was keen to see the wildlife that is attracted to the water. Most of the time the lake is dry " just like a vast, crusty saltpan. Dave was new to off-road driving and he had not had any training. Because of the big rain, the track was muddy in parts and one day his jeep lost traction going up a hill. His mates wedged the back wheels with stones, placed carpet strips under the front tyres as traction aids and pulled the jeep out of the mud with a winch. Some sections of the track were deeply rutted and one day, Dave got the undercarriage of his jeep stuck on the hump. His mates helped him jack up the jeep and fill under the tyres with sand so that he could drive off the hump. Then they showed him how to drive with one wheel in the rut and the other wheel on the middle hump. Soft sand was Dave's next challenge. He drove too fast. It wasn"t longbefore his wheels began to spin and he got stuck again. His mates had deflated their tyres so they didn"t dig into the sand as deeply as Dave's. Dave deflated his tyres, his mates laid down the carpet strips again and Dave got his vehicle out of the soft sand. Dave was looking forward to driving through water. It looked easy. Again, he drove too fast. This time, his engine failed. Fortunately, Dave's mates had packed some basic tools and supplies and quickly got his jeep going again. Lastly, Dave ran out of petrol. He did not have a spare tank. What do you think happened" Do you think Dave and his mates got to see Lake Eyre" Give your reasons.</p>

            <title>Atlantic Puffins  </title>
            <p>Atlantic puffins are a comical bird. They look funny with their bright orange beaks and big orange feet and are extermely entertaining to watch. In countries, like Iceland where puffins nest, they have been given nicknames like "clowns of the sea" and "sea parrots" and are often the subject of cartoons. Atlantic puffins are only found in the North Atlantic Ocean, where the weather is very cold. They spend most of their lives at sea and nest in colonies on coastal cliffs, in the breeding season. Puffins are well adapted to their environment. Perched high on steep cliffs near their nesting grounds, they can spot fish from a long way off and dive as far as 60 meters deep to catch them. They swim by flapping their wings underwater and using their feet to steer. In the breeding season, puffins" beaks get bigger and their feet and beaks turn bright orange. They dig burrows about 90 centimeters long in rocky cliffs, either in the soil or between rocks, and lay just one egg, each year. After the chick, known as a puffling, has hatched, the parent birds take turns bringing it fish to eat several times a day. At six weeks old, a chick can live alone. It heads off to the ocean without its parents and stays at sea until it is two to three years old. Puffins need to eat about forty small fish a day. They can catch several fish in one dive and their big, parrot-like beak is specially formed to hold a row of fish while it catches more. They can carry around ten fish at a time. The parent birds spend autumn and winter on the open ocean far from land and return each spring to their cliff-top breeding colony. They often become mates for life and use the same burrow year after year. Smoked puffin breast is a delicacy in Iceland and many people go sky fishing and trap puffins in nets. They also hunt for puffin eggs and feathers. Puffins live for about 20 years in the wild. Apart from people, their main predator is the great black-backed gull. Atlantic puffins are not an endangered species but some populations have been severely reduced in number. Puffin colonies are threatened by overfishing, which causes a shortage of food for adults to feed their young. Oil spills are also a danger. Oil not only destroys puffins" waterproofing, it also makes them sick when they clean it off their feathers. Global warming, as well, puts puffins at risk. These birds are adapted to living in water between -20 C and survive by catching fish that live in these cold temperatures. Not only are sea temperatures rising, sea levels are rising, too, and this could flood the puffins" breeding grounds.</p>

            <title>Battle of the Bugs: </title>
            <p>Green Ants and a Scorpion Gerty is a green tere ant. She lives in a colony of half a million ants. Scarp is a tere scorpion. Like spiders, scorpions have 8 legs and are easily recognised by their pincers and a segmented tail that ends with a very nasty stinger, full of venom. In some scorpions there is enough venom to kill a human being. One day Gerty, a worker ant, was foraging for food on her own, when she met Scarp. Although the scorpion was much bigger than her, Gerty knew no fear. She attacked Scarp, biting him fiercely with her serrated mandibles, then squirting formic acid from the tip of her tail into the wound. Scarp was enraged as the pain shot through his system. When he realized that this puny ant had inflicted the wound, he turned around and stabbed her with his stinger, killing Gerty almost instantly, but not before she had sent a strong chemical signal to her sisters at the nest. The other ants, realizing that Gerty had sacrificed her life for them, set out to attack the scorpion and bring it back for food. They followed the chemical trail left by Gerty and soon found Scarp. They bit the scorpion until he had no resistance left. Then they sucked up all his life juices as he lay dying and scattered his limbs all around. They took the best bits back to feed others in the nest.</p>

            <title>The 4-Minute Mile </title>
            <p>Before the introduction of the metric system, the mile was the most popular middle distance running race. In the early 1950s, no athlete had run the mile in 4 minutes and the record had stood at 4. "A minutes for nine years. But that was about to change. There were two fierce rivals for the title of first four-minute miler, Roger Bannister in England and John Landy in Australia. In May, 1954, Roger Bannister organised fellow-runners from Oxford University to help him make an assault on the 4-minute mile. A special race, which would only take place if the weather conditions were perfect, was set up in a small track in Oxford, for the sole purpose of enabling Bannister to run the mile in under 4 minutes. Chris Chataway and Chris Brasher acted as pacemakers and, pulled along in their slip steram, Bannister just managed to crack the record with a time of 3:59.4 minutes. Australians were disappointed and felt a bit cheated. However, within a couple of weeks, Landy had also broken the record, in a much faster time. Indeed, his record time of 3:57.9 minutes stood for more than three years. It wasn"t until the 1954 British Empire Commonwealth games that Landy and Bannister actually met in a race for the first time. Dubbed the "Miracle Mile", 10 million people listened to the race on the radio and millions more watched on TV as Landy ran his second sub-4-minute mile but lost to Bannister who ran his best ever time. This race is remembered for its dramatic ending. On the final lap, having led throughout the race, as Landy looked over his left shoulder, Bannister passed him on the right and won. While Landy was the second man to run the mile in less than 4 minutes, he is probably best remembered in Australia for what it did in the 1500 meters final at the 1956 Australian National Championships. Early in the third lap of the race, to the spectators' amazement, Landy stopped and went back to check on fellow runner, Ron Clarke, who had fallen. Clarke, who was the junior 1500 meter world champion at the time, and had been leading the race, got back to his feet and start running again. Landy followed. Incredibly, in the final two laps Landy made up a huge deficit and won the race, which was necessary for him to qualify for the Melbourne Olympics later that year. The incident became a legend in Australian sport, both as a great act of sportsmanship and also for the amazing time Landy ran. John Landy's sterngth of character has been much honoured since that scene, which took place over 60 years ago. In 2001, he was appointed Governor of Victoria, a position he held for 5 years. In 2006, John Landy had the honour of carrying the Queen's Baton into the arena of the Melbourne Commonwealth Games.</p>

            <title>The Kokoda Track </title>
            <p>In 1942, the Japanese plan was to invade Australia. But first they needed to isolate the country to prevent American troops from providing support. First, the Japanese took Singapore. Papua was the next objective. The Japanese landed troops at Buna and Gona on the Papuan north coast. They planned to take control of the 100 mile overland trail to Port Moresby, the main Australian base in New Guinea, and capture the town. But they had not reckoned with the terrain. The Kokoda Trail crosses the most rugged and isolated terrain in the world. The days are hot and humid and the nights intensely cold. The combination of heat and torrential rain provides a breeding ground for mosquitoes, and malaria was rampant. Neither the Japanese nor the Australians were prepared for these conditions. Tracking through dense jungle, soldiers could not see the enemy until they were within a few meters of them, nor the mines hidden in the thick undergrowth. Both armies had difficulty maintaining their supply lines. As a result, food was short and replacements, munitions and reinforcements unreliable. With no air support, the sick and wounded had to be carried out by Papuan porters, nicknamed the Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels by the Australian diggers they helped. The name was well deserved. The Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels cared for injured soldiers, even during heavy combat. It is likely that many more Australians would have died had it not been for their help. Although the Japanese took Port Morseby and made significant inroads along the Kokoda Track, they were unable to hold their positions when faced with an influx of Australian and American reinforcements. The Japanese reterated and Papua retained its independence.</p>

            <title>The Race to Land a Man on the Moon </title>
            <p>The Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union had been raging since the end of World War II, and while these two superpowers never officially declared war on each other, they fought indirectly in the wars of other countries, the arms race, and the space race. In 1961, Russia had the upper hand. They had launched the first satellite, known as Sputnilk and the first man, Yuri Gagarin, into space. Worried that the United States was falling behind the Soviet Union in technology and prestige, Presisdent Kennedy, in a speech to Congress in 1961, challenged the nation to put a man on the moon before the end of the decade, and bring him home safely. Kennedy did not live to see the fulfilment of his challenge. He was assassinated in 1963 and Richard Nixon was President when the three astronauts, Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins completed their historic space mission. Apollo II was the space flight that landed the first humans on the moon. The spacecraft had three parts: The Command Module , nicknamed the Eagle. On July 16, Apollo II was launched by a Saturn V rocket, the biggest rocket ever made, from the Kennedy Space Center. Once the last stage of the rocket had propelled the spacecraft towards the moon, it was three days before the astronauts entered into a lunar orbit. At this point, Armstrong and Aldrin moved into the spider-like Lunar Module and were blasted from the Command Module to the moon. Collins orbited the moon alone in the Command Module until it was time to meet up with them for the trip home, 21 hours later. As Armstong stepped onto the moon, watched by televison viewers the world over, he spoke the words for which he will always be remembered: "That's one small step for a man2 one giant leap for mankind." These words heralded a new reality: that one day, humans might live on the moon. Then he and Aldrin planted the American flag and saluted it. Armstrong and Aldrin spent about three hours on the moon. They collected rocks to take home and left mementoes, including  goodwill messages from 73 world leaders. It was July 20th, 1969 On July 24, 1969, eight days, three hours and eighteen minutes after lift-off, the Commmand Module, Columbia, splashed down in the Pacific. Mission accomplished. Aldrin, Armstrong, and Collins returned to a hero's welcome. The Command Module, Columbia, is now on display at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC.</p>

            <title>The Sinking of the Titanic </title>
            <p>Did you know that the sinking of the Titanic could have been avoided" Titanic, a British passenger liner, was the largest ship afloat when she left Southampton on April 10th, 1912 on her maiden voyage to New York. Photographs show a magnificent interior. So, it is not surprising that rich English and Americans were keen to get hold of first class tickets. The ship's owners were so sure that the Titanic was seaworthy that, when they were told that there were not enough life boats to take all the passengers and crew, they did nothing about it. They were sure that the Titanic was unsinkable. But they were wrong. What the ship's owners had not reckoned with was human error. And so, just before midnight on 15th April, 1912, after hitting an iceberg, Titanic sank and more than 1,500 people drowned. The main people involved in the disaster were determined to protect themselves and the ship's owners from prosecution and so important facts did not come out in court and the story that the ship was travelling too fast was accepted. More recent investigations have found that the death of so many people could have been prevented:. if the command from the bridge when the iceberg was first sighted had not been misinterpreted, causing the helmsman to turn the ship in the wrong direction. if the ship had stopped when it hit the iceberg instead of steaming off again. This made a long gash along one side of the vessel and caused water to pour into the separate compartments of the broken hull.. if the radio room on the Californian, the closest ship at the time the Titanic sank, had been operated 24 hours a day. if there had been enough lifeboats for all the crew and passengers. In fact, there were only enough places on the life boats for 1500 people, just over half of the 2200 on the ship. The sinking of the Titanic and the loss of so many lives demonstrated the need for maritime rules that were followed by all countries. New safety measures were put in place:. A ship's radio had to be monitored 24 hours a day. an international ice patrol was set up to look out for icebergs in the North Atlantic. an international agreement was made listing minimum safety standards at sea.</p>

            <title>A Mongolian Yurt </title>
            <p>A yurt is a portable home that has been used for thousands of years by Mongolian nomads. Many Mongolians live in yurts. They are very practical because when a family's herds have eaten all the grass near their yurt, they can dismantle it, pack it up, put it on a camel or yak and go to a new spot. The design of a yurt is clever and construction only takes about two hours. The walls are made from wooden struts and the roof has wooden rafters, tied together with rope made from camel or yak hair. To keep the occupants dry and warm, the rafters are covered with layers of fabric and felt, made from sheep's wool. In the middle of the roof is the crown. Because yurts do not have windows, the crown is very important. It is the Mongolians" equivalent of an air conditioner as parts of it can be opened and closed to let in more, or less, fresh air. Look at all the mod cons some nomadic Mongolians have today. They have a solar panel to heat water, a satellite dish for TV and a generator for power. Some families have a yak cart to ride in. Others have camels, motor bikes or trucks. Living in a yurt suits a nomadic way of life but even in towns and cities, some people live in yurts. Just as there are rich houses and poor houses, there are rich yurts and poor yurts. But, one thing is common to all yurts2 you have to keep them tidy because there is not much room. Rich families have TVs and fridges, tables, seats and beds. In the poorer yurts there are no beds or seats and family members sit and sleep on the floor. The stove is very important. It is used for cooking and to heat the yurt. Like a combustion heater, the smoke goes up the flue and into the air outside. Most parts of Mongolia are tereless and people use camel dung instead of wood. Camel dung keeps the flies away and makes a good fire for cooking on. When there is little grass left for the animals to eat and a family has to move, they do not sell their "house", they take it with them. First, they take all their belongings out of the yurt and then they dismantle it. Everything, including the kid goat, is packed onto the back of a yak, a camel or truck. Mongolian nomads move at least twice a year but they don"t travel far. In spring, they go to areas with good, open pasture where their herds can graze. At the beginning of winter, they go to camps that are naturally sheltered from the wind by mountains and have barns for the animals to shelter in at night.</p>

            <title>Christchurch Earthquake </title>
            <p>February 22, 2003 The Day Christchurch was Struck by a Magnitude 5.3 Earthquake. The day began normally. I got up, got dressed and went to school. There was nothing to indicate that this day would haunt me for years to come. We were in the middle of lunch when the earthquake hit like a bomb. The ground shook, the building shook, windows shattered, items that were not fixed to the wall, tumbled to the ground. Kids shouted, cried and screamed. I scrambled under my desk and held on to the legs so it would not move during the shaking, and waited. We all waited, now quiet, for our surroundings to still and the order to go outside and line up on the field. The noise was terrifying, as plaster and ceiling tiles rained down on us, among choking clouds of dust. Through the din, we could hear the sirens. The quake, and the swiftly following aftershocks, lasted less than 10 minutes. Gradually, everything calmed and we emerged from the protection of our desks into a world that was unrecognisable. The worst was the liquefaction " muddy water bubbling up through the cracked floors. There was shattered glass from broken windows, walls with cracks so wide you could put your arm through them, and everywhere there was dust, choking dust. And there were continual aftershocks2 smaller quakes you feel first in the soles of your feet that send a shudder through your body. The water mains broke at my school and just outside the doors, swirling over the playground, there was a river of muddy water that we had to wade through to reach the liquefaction-covered field. We worried about our family, our friends, our pets. Were they all right" Had they survived, as we had" Had our homes been hit" Mum collected me from school. I thought I knew what the aftermath of a quake was like. We had learned about it at school. But nothing could have prepared me for what I saw as we walked home. We sloshed through liquefaction and burst water mains on the flat, and, as the aftershocks continued, dodged rocks as they fell from the retaining walls that flank the steep road up the hill to our house. Mum told me there was some damage to our house. She told me that the fish had died when the CD box fell into their tank, smashing the glass cover. She warned me about the mess in the living room where the cabinet, that held her best glass, had burst open, spilling its contents across the floor. Dad's study was a terrible mess with books sterwn everywhere. Fortunately, Dad had bolted the bookcases to the wall so they did not topple over. My bedroom suffered the most structural damage. The windows shattered leaving nothing but empty frames and there was a gaping hole in one external wall. Roads were badly damaged: holes opened in the bitumen, liquefaction bubbled up, bridges twisted. There were traffic jams as everyone tried to get home. Dad and my sister, Kathryn, took many hours to travel what is usually a 20 minute trip. They drove at snail's pace, stopping and starting every few meter as they waited in a long line of cars, each trying to navigate a safe route along the damaged road. At one point they thought they were going to die as a huge building teetered alarmingly above them, and then held. Christchurch, my city, had been destroyed. Everywhere there was wreckage. Not just buildings and houses, road, bridges, power lines, mobile phone towers and phone lines were broken or damaged. Thick, muddy slush covered the ground and seeped into houses. This was a world I did not know. It would be a long time before life returned to normal.</p>

            <p>* a bath or backyard pool to float the boat in First, cut a rectangle of cardboard about thirty by fifteen centimeters. Use a ruler to draw a rectangle at one end of your cardboard, three centimeters from each side and about ten centimeters long. At the other end, draw a bow, the pointy bit at the front of a boat, as shown in the picture. Cut out your rectangle and put it to one side. You will need it later to use as a paddle. Then cut along your boat-shaped lines. Now, take the rectangle that you set aside and trim it by about seven millimeters on all sides. This does not have to be exact, but the paddle will need room to move freely when it is put back into the space you cut it from. Also, keep in mind that the duct tape will make the space narrower. Cover the cardboard shapes with duct tape so your boat does not get soggy and sink. Slip the rubber band onto your boat across the empty space you cut out. Slide the paddle  into the rubber band. Wind it up by twisting it around and let it go. If the paddle does not turn freely, trim it a bit more. After testing, you can staple the rubber band to the paddle to hold it in place. Wind up the paddle again. Hold it firmly and twist it around and around to increase the tension of the rubber band. Once you have twisted the rubber band at least 20 times, put the boat in a bath or backyard pool and let it go. If you enjoyed making your boat, you could make boats with your friends and have boat races.</p>

            <title>Mrs. Wilson's Accident </title>
            <p>Mrs. Wilson is a school principal. Running from the kindergarten to the staff room, she fell and broke her ankle. She was in a lot of pain. Mrs. Wilson hobbled to the staff room and a first aider applied an ice pack. "Ouch! That hurts," Mrs. Wilson complained. A member of staff took Mrs. Wilson to hospital where they x-rayed her ankle and put it in plaster. Mrs. Wilson is now limping around supported by crutches. She expects to go back to school in a week. News of Mrs. Wilson's fall soon got around. "Mum, do you know Mrs. Wilson fell over and broke her leg" There was blood everywhere and an ambulance came to get her." "You know Mrs. Wilson. Well, she had a bad accident today and she is in hospital. She got hit by a car and broke her legs." At After-School Care, several children were keen to share the news of Mrs. Wilson's accident. "Mrs. Wilson fell over this morning. She was on the ground moaning and groaning until the ambulance came to get her." "Yes," added another child. "And she was in a big pool of blood and her leg was all twisted." "Do you think she will die?" asked one child. "I don"t think so," replied the teacher. "But if she does, do you think we will get a day off school, or a present to help us feel better?"</p>

            <title>The Tomb of King Tut   </title>
            <p>The kings and queens who ruled Ancient Egypt were called pharoahs. When they died, they were buried in giant pyramids or secret tombs with all their belongings, because Egyptians believed they would need their belongings in the afterlife. Many pharoahs were buried in the Valley of the Kings. Tutankhamun, "King Tut" for short, is probably the best known pharaoh because his tomb was found with everything still in it, completely untouched. All the other tombs had been raided, and the gold and jewels stolen, by grave robbers who tunnelled their way into the pyramids using flares to provide light. Howard Carter, who had spent his life exploring historical sites in Egypt, was convinced that there was at least one more tomb in the Valley of the Kings: the tomb of King Tutankhamun. He was right. But it took his team over four years to find it. Carter's Expedition was funded by Lord Carnarvon who, after four fruitless years, was ready to give up on it. But Carter persuaded him to finance the dig for one more year. In November 1922, Carter found some steps which he was convinced would lead to the tomb. Carnarvon hurried over from England and watched on as Carter chiselled a small hole in the door way and with the light of a candle peered inside. "What can you see?" Carnarvon asked, to which Carter replied, "Wonderful things!" When Howard Carter discovered King Tut's tomb, he found a huge chamber with four rooms filled with everything the king would need in the afterlife: beds, chariots, games, valuable artefacts, walking sticks , clothes, bows and arrows, even food. In one room was a stone coffin that contained three smaller coffins, one inside the other. The two outer coffins were made of wood, covered in gold foil and intricately carved. One was inlaid with coloured glass and semi-precious stones. The innermost coffin contained the mummified remains of King Tut's body. A fabulous death mask in the image of the dead man covered the face of the mummy to make sure that his spirit would recognise him in the afterlife. The innermost coffin and the death mask were made of gold. Carter's find was the most significant discovery for many years. At the time, it was one of the two tombs that had been found as it was when the tomb was sealed more than 3000 years before.</p>

            <title>The Vietnam War   </title>
            <p>The communist threat dominated the minds of American politicians in the 1940s. Their concerns increased when Ho Chi Minh, leader of the communist government of North Vietnam, launched a guerrilla campaign against South Vietnam. Ho's goal was to overthrow the government of the south and unite the country under communist rule. Determined to stop the spread of Communism, the United States began by training the South Vietnamese army and providing military advisors to help combat the guerrillas. However, the attack on a US warship by North Vietnamese torpedo boats led to US reprisals and in 1945, US aircraft began bombing targets in North Vietnam and the first American fighting troops arrived. The Vietnam War was very different from previous wars in Europe and America, which had been mainly fought by big armies facing off against each other. While there, were small delete battles like Long Tan, the Viet Cong made sure that most of the action took place in the sweltering jungle of South Vietnam and involved small unit action. For the Americans, and their Australian allies, not only was the territory unfamiliar, but they were ill-prepared and ill-equipped for this kind of warfare. The Viet Cong had another advantage. They had access to a vast network of connecting tunnels that spread across the country. As well as providing soldiers with places to hide during combat, the tunnels served as communication and supply routes, hospitals, somewhere to hide food and weapons and sleeping quarters and kitchens for the fighters from North Vietnam. The tunnels were well hidden. And so were most of the fighters, who were active at night, did not wear uniforms and blended into the local communities during the day. The tunnels were also well protected. To deter American and Australian troops from entering them, the Viet Cong set up explosive booby traps and Punji stake pits with devastating results. In 1973, after five years of diplomatic wrangling, a peace accord was signed in Paris ending the conflict. America and Australia began to withdraw their troops. However, this did not end the war. A brief period of peace followed, but in late 1974, North Vietnamese forces recommenced hostilities. They captured Saigon on April 30, 1975, drove a tank through the gates of the Presidential Palace and raised their flag. With this symbolic act, the Vietnam War came to an end. South Vietnam was forced to surrender, and the country was reunited under Communist rule. Forty years have passed since the Vietnam war ended. Vietnam is still a very poor country but in recent years, it has become more stable and now has a growing economy.</p>

            <title>Tsunami Hits Sumatran Coast </title>
            <p>In 2006, three days after Christmas, Dan, a press photographer, left for Indonesia to report on the devastating tsunami that had just hit the northern tip of Sumatra. Dan's translator on this trip was Amat, who met him at Jakarta airport. Together, they flew to Banda Aceh and the next day, they drove to the coast. Dan was horrified by what he saw. Entire villages and towns had been reduced to rubble, the wreckage piled meters high, as if a bomb had landed there. The only people to be seen were volunteers looking for corpses and locals hoping to find remnants of the life they once knew. Witnesses told Dan that as the tsunami approached, water was first dragged hundreds of meters back from the shore, stranding fish and boats on the sand. Then about five minutes later, a wall of water, travelling at high speed and rising to thirty-five meters, hit the beach. The first wave was followed within half an hour by two more huge waves. Water rushed inland, extending as far as five kilometers across low-lying land sweeping away almost everything in its path. People were drowned as they tried to reach higher ground, and others trapped in their homes or on the beach. Witnesses compared the sound of the tsunami to three freight trains or the roar of a jet. Amidst the horror, there were tales of survival: the fisherman who turned his boat into the giant waves, while those who steered away died2 and the young woman who was dragged out to sea by the reterating waters of the tsunami and survived for five days by clinging onto a sago palm and eating its fruits and bark. Although she saw several sharks, they didn't attack her. Another woman grabbed a floating wooden beam as she was being carried by the turbulent water. Others clung to teres, and a baby was found alive on her matterss, floating amidst the remains of her home. A 20-year old man drifted for eight days. He was rescued by a container vessel about 180 kilometers from his home in Banda Aceh, clinging onto a floating tere trunk, frantically waving for help. He was sunburnt, dehydrated and starving and had survived on rainwater and coconuts. In contrast to the large number of people who died, few animal bodies were found after the tsunami. Locals reported that both wild and domestic animals fled to higher ground before the tsunami arrived. They seemed to know that disaster was imminent. The only building in Banda Aceh that withstood the tsunami was the mosque where many people took refuge. They were crammed together on the roof for hours, their numbers increasing as people were pulled out of the swirling water as it rushed past. They say that a picture tells a thousand words and Dan hoped that his photographs would bring home to the world the terrible plight of the people of Aceh and their desperate need for help, lots of help, to support the province through the long process of recovery and rebuilding.</p>

            <title>A Wonderful Place: </title>
            <p>A Memory Walking back to the homestead was tough, very different from our terk into the range. I had found out about a rough track through the bush near the sheep station where I was staying with friends. We were in the Flinders Ranges several hundred kilometers north of Adelaide. Our old house was on the track I was following and it twisted into the range at the back of Arkaba Station. There, we were told, was the meeting place of two creeks which combined to form the mighty Hookina Creek. Mostly it was dry but after heavy rain it thundered down with a force which carried whole gum teres at an astonishing height. I have seen great trunks and branches stuck three meters high in other gum teres. In flood, the creek also grew wide and the red mud was spread all around. So as we set out, the going was easy. We were fresh and light-hearted and light-footed. It was several years since I had walked here and I delighted in seeing this place again. This country was amazing. The mountains changed colours as the day progressed. At midday they were stark, rough and strong colours of brown and yellow in the harsh light. Behind us on the plain was a vast area which had been cleared for farming as long ago as the 1878s when some optimists thought that if they planted wheat and ran sheep, rain would follow. It didn"t and the land is now studded with a few small homesteads and many more piles of rubble where farmers were forced to leave their land. Even further away are crystal, salt lakes shining fiercely under the intense sun. We trudged on and on, determined to find the place where all three creeks came together. Our lunch eaten and most of our water drunk, my mate and I began to feel weary when we finally came upon the waterhole which marked the place we wished to find. Quickly we stripped off and jumped in. It was cold and refreshing and we were tempted to stay, but we also knew that we had to return to the homestead before the light went. For the first hour we had high spirits but then we noticed more and more, the roughness of the track, the hardness of the stones and our increasingly sore feet. In the last flood the creek had changed its course and the boulders now seemed larger and harder to get round. The one good thing was that the heat faded as the day wore on as a slight breeze made us feel better. Our water was finished and we were getting very hungry and we still had far to go but we were definitely slowing down. The day was closing in with shadows becoming longer and the parrots and galahs beginning to settle in the gums by the creek. Some hills grew deep shadows and yet others were lit up by the sun going down. They turned to gold, orange and then deep purple. And then the sun really began to set with the same fiery colours that we had seen in the hills. The sky had just enough cloud to make the whole scene spectacular. The birds quietened and darkness came. Without light the track was tough to follow along the creek bed. The stars came out but we were in the shadows and although the sky was very clear and brilliant it didn"t help us much. A light shone ahead. As we had climbed the bank of the creek it popped up over our horizon. It was far off but we thought it was the homestead and we were right. We could also hear the shouts of our friends and suddenly we saw the flare of the outdoor barbeque pit alight. A bonfire lit up the sky and all our tiredness and the roughness of the track forgotten, we began to run.</p>

            <title>Irish the Scallywag </title>
            <p>Here is a picture of "Irish" , an Airedale Terrier, on the day I brought him home. He was 6 months old and was a rescue dog. The family that gave him up had a 2 year old child and the minute I saw him I understood why they could not keep him. He is smart and energetic and a real scallywag. He does behave well but he tries to exert his own will as we interact. Look at that face! You can see the mischief in his eyes! Irish follows me around all day long and loves to go outside. The one thing he is afraid to do is going down the basement steps, so he sits at the top and watches and waits for us to come up the steps. He really wants to go down them but the furnace is down in the basement and when it starts up, it frightens him for some reason. If we come in from outside into the basement he will go up the steps but going down is just a no-no. Here he is, a few weeks after we brought him home, as he waits for me coming up the steps. I brought Irish home in December. It was winter where I live so he had to deal with snow. We had several storms that left us with a good amount of snow and Irish could not get enough of it. He loved to run, romp, chase his ball and roll in the snow. With his fur being so thick and wiry, he would come to the door covered in little snowballs clinging to his legs, his paws and his belly. We found out that we could take a wire kitchen whisk and run it over him, removing most of the snowballs. Of course, he would then try to eat them, as he is a scallywag! He really did love to run and romp in the snow and got very excited to go outside when it was on the ground. You can see from this picture how excited he gets. He is probably 8 months old in these snow photos. In this one he is trying to get me to play rough by doing his fake attacks and running at me. His ears always seem to stand up and he has a really big mouth full of teeth! Below he is running as fast as he can to get the blue ball ahead of him. When he goes that fast, it looks like he is flying. In addition to being full of energy, he is also lazy when he has the chance to lie around in the sun. He prefers the shade when it is hot. When you approach him he usually rolls over on his back to beg to be scratched. This day was nice and sunny and he heard me coming so he raised his head to look. You can see how cute he looks and he knows it. It seems like he is always plotting something to get into! In this photograph, it looks like Irish is keeping an ear out to hear what is going on, but the wind was blowing his ear upright when I took the picture. We had been romping and he was worn out and taking a rest, building up energy to begin again. When in the house, Irish keeps a close watch on anything happening outside. He likes to look out the windows and watch people walk by. Irish thinks he is a tough guy so he barks. In this picture, he was as still as a statue, carefully watching something outside. He was so still and straight he looks like a bookend. Irish was nine months old here. He was starting to look like an older dog but still acting like a little puppy. This photograph was taken in spring. The grass was becoming green again and the weather was getting warmer. The birds that left for winter were returning and other wildlife was on the move. I live on the edge of a wood so we get many animals coming through the yard, like this turtle Irish discovered. Irish had never seen a turtle before and was very curious. He pawed at it and walked around it, trying to understand what it was. I didn"t let him bite it though, as he has so many sharp teeth and very strong jaws. I did not want the turtle to get hurt. We ended up taking the poor creature back to the edge of the woods to let it go. As I said before, Irish can be a real scallywag. He likes to drink out of our fountain when he is outside and gets really sloppy when he does. He gets water all over his face and long whiskers and then it drips as he walks around. Just when you are least expecting it, he likes to come up and give you a big, wet, sloppy kiss. It is sort of like taking a big sponge, dipping it in cold water then putting it up against your face, cold and wet. This is the last thing you see when he sneaks up on you to give you a kiss. Irish is a barrel of laughs and fun all day long. We get up very early and he and I spend most of the day together. Right now he is sleeping and dreaming up some new mischief to get into. He will think of something! That's what scallywags do!</p>

            <title>The Tank Man of Tiananmen Square </title>
            <p>I was born in the Chinese city of Shanghai. My parents, who were Hungarian Jews, fled Europe to escape the Nazis, just before the outbreak of World War II. When the war ended, the Americans sent in aid, and their soldiers, who were heroes to us, took over Shanghai. Their army trucks went all over the city and it was easy to hitch a ride with them, to get around. One day, when I was 5 years old, my mum and dad took me to a park by the river. They spotted a little green frog on a big leaf in a lily pond. But I couldn"t see the frog and that made me so cross, I got in a paddy. Mum and Dad decided to leave me and sat down on a bench nearby. Eventually, I saw the frog. But, by then, I was so cross I thought, "I"ll show them!" and I walked out of the park. As it cost money to get into the park, I couldn"t go back in, so I decided to hitch a ride home in a GI truck. Sure enough, there was a GI truck on the Garden Bridge by the big Broadway Mansions building, which I called the "High House". What I didn"t know was that the truck was going in the wrong direction and before long I was in a part of Shanghai I didn"t recognise. I got off the truck as soon as I could, as I was too scared to admit my mistake. I wandered about for hours in strange sterets, getting more and more lost, until it got dark. And then, I began to cry. A nice Chinese man, dressed in a suit, saw me and stopped and asked me if I was lost. I said I was. He told me his name was Mr Chang. I was so tired, he put me on his shoulders and walked around asking me if I could recognize any landmarks. And then I saw it " my "High House". He wasn"t sure, and as he lived nearby, he took me to his home. When we got there, Mr Chang's wife prepared a little food, some rice and vegetables, and watched me eat it. Then Mr Chang took me to his children's bedroom. He had about ten children and they all slept together on one big matterss on the floor, alternately head to foot. It was easy to find room to slip in an extra one, and that's where I spent the night. In the morning, Mr Chang took me to the corner of the "High House" on his way to work. He didn"t want to leave me, but I insisted I could find my way home from there. It was a very long walk along Seward Road to the lane where we lived. I eventually got there and ran up the stairs to our little flat at the top of the building. But there was nobody home. I went downstairs and knocked on the door of the old Russian man who lived in the ground floor flat. When he saw me, he couldn"t believe his eyes. "Everyone's out looking for you. Your parents haven"t slept all night, with worry. You stay here and don"t move!"  When my mum got back, she gave me a big hug. But when I finally met up with my father, he was very, very cross and I was grounded for a month.</p>

            <title>The Broken Ballerina </title>
            <p>There was always the tinkle of music in the toy shop on the high steret. As Christmas drew near, the music changed to the carols Annie knew so well. Children went in on their way home from school, first to look and then to show their parents or grandparents the toys they liked best. Each day on her way home from school, Annie passed the toy shop. Each day she peered through the window to admire the toys. Then one day she gathered up her courage, opened the door and went inside. The bell tinkled. Annie marvelled at the sight of so many toys but the toy she wanted most was a musical box with a ballerina whose head had broken off. The head lay abandoned on the shelf. Day after day, Annie went into the shop and wandered around. Each day she stopped and gazed at the broken ballerina. Then, one day the old shopkeeper asked her if he could help. She told him she wanted to buy the musical box so she could repair the ballerina but her family was poor and she had no money. "Well, you can"t have it," the man replied firmly. Disappointed, but accepting, Annie left. As soon as she had gone, the shopkeeper felt bad. What good was the musical box to him" He should have thrown it away years ago. He went to the door but the girl had disappeared. He waited for her the next day, but she didn"t return. More than a week passed before he saw the girl again gazing in through the window. He hobbled to the door and invited her inside. Then, he heard himself not only offer to give her the musical box but to mend it as well. Annie watched in amazement as the pieces were carefully fitted together. The old man was pleased with his work but his pleasure was nothing compared to that of the little girl. Carefully he wrapped up the musical box and handed it to Annie. It was the first toy she had ever owned.</p>

            <title>The Tank Man of Tiananmen Square </title>
            <p>The world looked on in amazement when this photograph was beamed across the world. It was June 5th 1989, the morning after the Chinese military had suppressed the Tiananmen Square protests by force, killing and injuring many civilians. Would they kill the young man standing in the middle of the road" The man wore a white shirt and black pants, and held two shopping bags, one in each hand. As the tanks came to a stop in front of him, he waved his bags at them, seemingly signalling them to go back. Instead, the lead tank tried to drive around him. But each time the tank changed direction, the man got in its way. When the lead tank stopped, the young man stood in front of it. Then, to the amazement of onlookers, he clambered onto the front of the tank, briefly spoke to the driver, and climbed up to the turret to talk to the gunners. Then he climbed down and stood to one side. The tanks restarted their engines ready to continue but when the young man saw they were not turning round, he leapt in front of the lead vehicle again. Each time the tank tried to get round him, he stepped into its path. He seemed to know no fear. How long could this go on" Would the order come from the column of tanks to drive on" Would the young man be shot or crushed by the mighty weight of a tank" We held our breath as we waited to see what would happen next. The stand-off between man and tank continued until a cyclist slowly crossed in front of the tank and spoke to the young man. At the same time, two men rushed onto the road, grabbed the young man and dragged him out of the path of the tanks and into the crowd. He was never seen again. The tanks rolled on. The Tank Man disappeared and to this day, we know neither his name nor his fate.</p>

            <p>All snakes have scales, shed skin, and do not chew food. Snakes can use belly scales to move. Most snakes lay eggs. Snake skin can be bright. Snake skin can be pale and dull. A snake that has dull skin can help itself from getting eaten because it blends into its habitat. A snake may make a home in a cave, by a lake, in sand, and in grass. It can be a pet. You may spot a snake if you rake. It may be tame. It may cause pain. Take care and wait for help to relocate a snake. It is fun to gaze at a snake, but it is risky to lift it. We must not hate snakes. Snakes are not tame, but stay from harm's way and you will stay safe.</p>

They will train for flight in space. They will ride miles high into the sky inside a rocket. On a flight, they can glide and rise just like a kite. To see a night sky from space is quite a terat. If you might like to fly in space, study a lot. You might find yourself high in the sky!</p>

I want to fly in the sky in real life."  "Be realistic, Mike. Kids cannot fly,"  says Mrs. Pike.  "I know, but I can dream,"  sighs Mike.</p>

Rice grows well when the land is wet. An animal represents each year in China. I was born in the year of the rabbit."  Henry finished reading. The class sprang to their feet and clapped.

Set newspaper at the bottom. Provide a small box in the tank for the snake to hide under. Snakes like hiding spots. To keep the snake warm, set a heat lamp near the tank. Snakes do not need to eat every day, but they always need water in the tank. Snakes sleep a lot. Be careful when you hold a snake. You need to be aware that snakes can bite. But many snakes are harmless and you do not need to be afraid of them. You can have a pair of snakes as pets. Before getting asnake, you need to prepare. Go to a pet store and ask questions. Compare different kinds of snakes.</p>

            <p>Water runs in a cycle. A cycle is when the same thing repeats itself. First, water falls from the sky in a rainstorm, hailstorm, or snowstorm, or as sleet. When rain hits the land, it can soak into the dirt or can be runoff that flows into riverbeds, sterams, and lakes. Some precipitation can turn into groundwater. Next, water evaporates from the ground and from bodies of water like lakes and sterams. When it evaporates, it turns into a gas called water vapor. In the next step of the cycle, the gas will change back to water and can make a cloud. When a lot of gas changes back, the cloud will get heavy. This will make rain fall and then the cycle can start over.</p>

            <p>There are lots of ways to get energy. Most places burn fossil fuels. These fuels will not last. They can make the air dirty, too, so we need to look for new ways to get energy. Using the sun is a clean way to get energy. The name for this is solar power. People can use panels on top of their homes to catch the sun's rays. The sun's energy can be changed to electrical power and can also be used for heat. We can get clean energy from the wind, too. A lot of space is needed for wind power. A group of windmills needs to be set up to catch the wind. Water is also a way of getting clean energy. Running water can spin huge wheels. This energy can be changed to many other kinds of energy for use by people.</p>

The class looked around to where he was pointing and a whale dove under the water! The kids were enjoying the sight of a real live whale. Then they heard an annoying rumbling sound that was like snoring. "Watch this,"  said Troy. The whale blew water out of its blowhole! Soon it was time to go back. All the kids in the class howled at Troy, begging him not to go back and end the voyage.</p>

            <title>Coral Reefs </title>
            <p>Coral reefs are found in warm, shallow salt water where the current is calm. They start out small and can grow to be very large. They are like a mall of living things sprawled across the sea floor. They are home to plants such as seaweed and animals including crabs, sea urchins, sponges, sea turtles, and all different kinds of fish. Dolphins sometimes pause in a reef to eat. Coral looks like a plant but is actually an animal. There are many kinds of corals that come in an array of colors like red, pink, orange, and green. Some corals are hard while others are soft. The soft corals can move with the waves. Many reefs are being destroyed by humans, so it is important to protect them.</p>

            <p>Paul and his family lived in the city, but they were moving to the suburbs. The city was full of tall buildings. In the suburbs, there were a lot of lawns with green grass. Their new house was near the beach! Paul would be able to take walks near the water and swim in the sea with his mom and dad. Paul could not wait to feel the salt water on his skin. He hoped one day he could be taught how to surf. Maybe someday he could surf near a coral reef. In his new room, Paul could hear the crashing of the waves. Paul thought this would keep him awake at night, but the sound of the waves was soothing and helped Paul to fall asleep. Paul loved living in the suburbs!</p>

            <p>Horses have always been important to American culture. In early colonial times, people used horses to help with farming and travel. They would use bridles to help control the horses. Wild horses used to run free throughout the United States, but as more people came to the country, they started to become tame. A wild horse is also called a mustang. Today, mustangs only live in the western states. Mustangs can find sanctuary in lands that are protected by the federal government. It is difficult to keep this land because people want to develop it into homes and malls. Habitat is very important to wild horses. It is an ongoing battle to protect them. You are able to see these beautiful creatures if you visit a sanctuary in the West.</p>

            <p>In 1848, James Marshall was looking for lumber by the American River in California. He saw something glimmering, it was gold! Soon, everyone heard about the gold in California. By 1841, people were traveling to California to try for the new "American Dream" to get rich quickly. These people were called  "forty-niners."  Many left their wives and children behind when they left to find gold. They came to California by wagon and by ship for the golden terasure. The trip to California from the East was very difficult. Many traveled by ship since there was no railroad. People got seasick, and the food on the ships became rotten. People from the central states traveled by wagon on the Oregon Trail. Soon, there were many people in California looking for gold. They got the gold from sterams and riverbeds by using simple methods. The most popular was called panning. Some people found gold often and got very rich. Others were not so lucky. There were other ways to make money in California. Women had jobs cooking and cleaning. Chicken farmers could charge a lot of money for eggs. Soon there were so many people looking for gold that most of the gold ran out. People who came late into the Gold Rush found disappointment instead of riches. The season of fast money was over. Many people went home, but some stayed in California and kept digging. A few of them found more gold, but most had broken dreams of unfound fortune. The Gold Rush was over.</p>

She had no dresses that looked like they were from the 1840s. She pulled a bunch of dresses out of a carton she had in the back of the closet. "Ugh,"  she said, holding one up.  "This one has too many buttons."  She pulled out another and wrinkled her nose.  "I don?t like this one, either. The color makes me look like a pumpkin!"  She held up dress after dress and didn?t like any of them. All of a sudden, she had an idea! She could make a new dress out of all the old ones! Hayden got out her sewing kit and got to work. She took a satin dress she thought was too long and shortened it. Then she pulled a persimmon ribbon off of another dress and sewed it on the new one. She widened the straps to make it more stunning. Finally, she stitched the whole dress together with golden thread. Now the dress was finished! She spun in front of the mirror so she could see it from all sides. It was perfect! Hayden was ready to go to the dance. She was just in time, too, because her cousin was there to pick her up. She opened the door to show off her new dress.  "How beautiful!"  her cousin said.  "You look just like a person from the Gold Rush!" </p>

Callie took a blanket out of her pack and spread it on the ground. Hermom and dad took out the picnic basket and started handing out sandwiches. They smelled so good. "I love the scent of cheese sandwiches,"  said Callie. "I know,"  said her mom.  "That's why Grandma sent them for you."  Callie and her parents munched away on their lunch, listening to the sounds of the forest. It was very quiet and peaceful. Out of the corner of her eye, Callie spotted something. When she looked more closely, she saw a group of deer behind a bush. "Look,"  she whispered, pointing out the deer to her mom and dad. "Aww, look at the does and their babies,"  said Mom.  "They are all dozing. I would like to doze like that,"  she said wistfully. "How do you know they are does?"  asked Callie. "They are does because they have no antlers,"  Dad replied. As Callie and her parents were watching them, one of the deer started to lick her baby.  "That is so dear,"  said Mom.  "She is giving her baby a bath."  Callie leaned in to get a closer look, but by accident she leaned on a branch, and it snapped! The deer got scared and ran away. "Oh well,"  said Callie.  "It was fun to watch them for a little bit."  Her dad took dessert out of the basket. "Mmm, chocolate mousse!"  exclaimed Callie. "Who knows" Maybe we will see a moose while we eat our mousse!"

            <title>Uncovering Clues from the Past </title>
            <p>A fossil is what is left behind by an animal or a plant that lived in the past. Nonliving things do not leave fossils behind. Fossils can tell us something about how the animal or plant lived. There are different ways that fossils can form. Sometimes, when a living thing dies, it can get buried underneath mud. Over a long period of time, it can become a fossil. The hard parts like bones, teeth, and shells are most likely to become fossils. Another way a fossil can form is if a plant or animal gets preserved in ice or tere sap. The tere sap gets hard and turns into amber. Some animals will leave behind footprints that get fossilized. This is called an imprint. Leaves can also leave imprints. You can see the outline of the leaf in the imprint. A paleontologist is a scientist who studies fossils. He or she will spend a lot of time digging for them. When a paleontologist unearths a fossil, it is very exciting. Sometimes it will be an animal or a plant that was previously undiscovered. Fossils can give paleontologists clues to the past. Sometimes, fossils are found in unexpected places. For example, a fossilof an animal that lived in the water might be uncovered on a mountain. The place where this fossil was found must have been covered by water in the past. Earth does not remain unchanged over time. An area that is a desert or mountain in present day might have been part of the sea in prehistoric times. Fossils can give scientists evidence ofsuch things.</p>

            <p>Brandon had always loved the sea. He loved everything about it?the water, the sand, and especially all the animals. One day, he was walking along the beach with his mom, keeping his eye on the sand for anything he could find, when he encountered a great big shell. It was unlike anything he had ever seen before. Unable to control his excitement, Brandon picked up the shell. It was perfect! It was unbroken with many colors. He thought it would be great to add this shell to his collection. Brandon was unprepared for what he would discover when he turnedover the shell! What a shock he had when he saw that there was something living inside the shell! Brandon had never found a shell before that actually had a living creature inside of it. Brandon quickly took out his book of sea animals. He wanted to find out what kind of animal he had uncovered. He inspected the shell carefully for its colors and markings and looked closely at the animal inside of it. The shell was large and had a spiral shape. The animal inside looked like a big snail. Brandon flipped through his book so he could name his discovery. After some searching, he found a match! It was a conch! His book said it was uncommon to find a living conch lying on the beach. He did not want to misterat the conch, so Brandon decided he would put it back in the water. Brandon knew if he told his friends about the conch, they would think it was nonsense. They were unlikely to believe him, so he unpacked his camera to take picturesof the conch. Brandon said goodbye to the conch and placed it back in the sea. He then continued his search on the beach for moresea terasures.</p>

            <p>Wilbur and Orville Wright were obsessed with the idea of flying. When they were boys, their father gave them a flying toy. They found the toy irresistible and dreamed of the day when they could make a machine that would let them fly! When Wilbur and Orville grew up, they became bicycle builders. There were countless bicycle shops all over town, but the Wright Brothers? shop was different. Not only were Wilbur and Orville building bicycles, but they were also experimenting with wings. They were going to figure out how to make a flying machine. Many people thought they were foolish, but the brothers were unstoppable. Their first flying machine had a five-foot wingspan. It was too small and unstable to hold a person, but Wilbur and Orville knew that they would be able to use this model in the development of a machine that a person could fly. Finally, in 1903, the Wright Brothers finished their first full-sized flying machine. They called it the Flyer. On December 17, 1903, the Wright Brothers were the first pilots when their Flyer took off from Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, and they flewsuccessfully for 120 feet. Their flight only lasted 12 seconds, but the idea of human flight was now a reality. The impossible childhood dream of Wilbur and Orville Wright had become real. They were the first aviators. They had made history, and their flying machine became a useful tool in developing the airplanes we use today.</p>

Kat and her parents got to the show just in time. The performance was about to begin. They all waited excitedly for the first plane. Kat heard rumbling and watched the plane climb upwards. Soon it was over her head! It was quickly joined by three other planes. The sound was so loud, she jumped! "Don?t worry, Kat,"  her mom yelled over the noisy planes. Kat and her family watched the planes. They did many incredible tricks in the sky! When the show was over, Kat wanted to see the planes on the ground, so her parents took her over.

"Is it hard work?"  asked Kat. "Yes, but if you stay persistent, you will become universally known,"  she said. Kat beamed happily at the pilot. It was her dream to become a great pilot! The pilot gave her a packet. It was full of papers she could fill out to gain membership to the Junior Pilot's Club. It was getting cloudy, and her parents wanted to go before the rain started.

            <p>Ants live all over the world. The only places where ants did not always live are Antarctica, Greenland, Iceland, and Hawaii. In these places, ants are an invasive species. This means that they were not always found there. They were brought in from somewhere else. There are thousands of ant species. They are insects that are related to wasps and bees. Ants have three body parts. They are the head, the thorax, and the abdomen. Ants have six legs and a pair of antennae. Most ants are usually red or black, but some other colored ants exist. Some ants are even metallic! Ants live in colonies which can have millions of members. An ant colony has many females, and sometimes there are males present. Some of the female ants are called queen ants. Some ant colonies have only one queen, but there are other colonies that can have multiple queens. The other female ants in the colony are called worker ants. They are smaller than the queen and take care of the queen and her eggs. Male ants are called drones and have a shorter life span than female ants. A queen ant can live for up to 30 years. Ants are very strong animals. They can carry things that are 10 to 20 times their own body weight. When they need to carry things that are too heavy for just one ant, they will work together to move the object. Ants are not solitary animals. They are social because they live together in colonies and work together for the good of the colony.</p>

Jenna said. Reluctantly, Madeline got up and helped Jenna and the others to move a huge slice of bread into the nest. Finally, the work day was done. It was time to go to the great hall where the workers would show the queen all the food they had found. The queen was very happy with the job the workers had done that day.  "Your hard work will pay off,"  she said.  "All the food that you brought to the nest will supply enough nutrients for the colony for many weeks. Now it is time to celebrate!"  All the worker ants were overcome with joy at the queen's praise and started to cheer and dance. Before long, Madeline joined in. She was tired but could not resist the fun. She danced with Jenna and all her other friends. She was twirling all around and moving to the beat of the music. She was having such a good time, she did not notice that it was getting very late. Before she knew it, it was after midnight! "It is so late, and I am so tired,"  she said to her friends.  "I can?t believe we danced the whole night away!" exclaimed Jenna. "It sure was fun, but now I must go to sleep!"  Madeline said, trying to stifle a yawn. All her friends agreed it was time for the party to end. They all said goodnight. When Madeline got into bed, she fell asleep immediately and dreamed of her nightof dancing.</p>

He really enjoys reading books. He even visits a science center on weekends. He dreams of placing his feet on the moon and making footprints. "Yes, it is important to study" Brice said to Mrs. Price.
