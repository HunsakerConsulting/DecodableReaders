<p>Mirtle lives on a ranch in Australia with a bunch of camels. Mirtle is sad. She thinks she is odd. All the camels have a hump. But Mirtle's back is flat. "How can I get a hump?" she asks the ants. The ants offer to make an anthill on her back. Mirtle settles down on the sand and the ants build an anthill on her back. But, the moment Mirtle stands up, the anthill slips off. Mirtle feels awful. She weeps and the ants attempt to cheer her up. But to no avail. "Perhaps if I drink a lot, I will grow a hump on my back," thinks Mirtle. They say camels keep water in their humps. Mirtle drinks lots and lots of water but still she has no hump. Mirtle grows sadder and sadder. The rest of the camels tell her she is OK. She is different, but she is OK. Then, one morning, the owner turns up with an animal that has no hump. It looks like Mirtle. "Perhaps I"m not so odd," thinks Mirtle. "Here is another camel without a hump." Mirtle runs up to the animal and nuzzles it. "I am so happy to see you," she hums. "I thought I was odd. But now, I am not the only camel without a hump." Mick , the new arrival, grins. "You are not odd," he replies . "You are just not a camel. Like me , you are an alpaca." Soon , there was a little alpaca and before long there were more alpacas than camels.</p>
