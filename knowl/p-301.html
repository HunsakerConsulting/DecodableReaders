<p>Arthur is a goat. He was deserted by his herd. "I do not need to go with a herd!" thinks Arthur. "I will be fine without them." He finds five yaks. He lives with them. Their names are FernKurtBertWes, and Fay. Arthur likes to eat wheat. He has a lot of fur but runs and hides when it freezes outside. "I hate the snow!" Arthur moans. "I leave when the snow falls." "YesArthur, it is true. That is what you do!" say the yaks. The yaks do not feel bad for Arthur. His fur is soft and keeps him very warm!</p>
