<p>Lee likes to tell funny, silly tales. He tells tales about his dreams. Lee had a silly dream of a queen. Nineteen green beans got stuck deep in the mud. A queen sees the green beans and tries to free them from the mud. But the hill is too steep, and she cannot get to them. The queen tells a bee to get the beans. But the bee will not speak. "Please, bee. I am too weak" weeps the queen. The bee tells three fleas to help. The queen, bee, and fleas get the beans. They eat the beans at a feast. The beans are a yummy terat!</p>
