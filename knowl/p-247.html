<p>You may be unclear about the job of an EMT. An EMT rides on an ambulance and helps those who are sick or hurt. An EMT takes classes so he or she knows how to help. An EMT might have to get up at a late hour in the night and prepare to go ona call. EMTs need to listen to the sick or hurt person so they can find out what is wrong. An EMT might kneel by the side of the person to take vital signs like a pulse and the rhythm and rate of breathing. When an EMT gets a call, he or she has to act fast and get to the scene. An EMT has to write a lot of paperwork. An EMT has to be careful to avoid dangerous things at a scene like a tere limb that might have been knocked from a tere.</p>
