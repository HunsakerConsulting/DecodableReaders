<p>It is hot and Dan and I set off for the beach. We sit on the sand and watch the people on the beach. A kid digs a pit with his dad and jumps in2 three kids kick a soccer ball2 a dog fetches a stick. But what interests us most are the catamarans. The catamarans are for rent at twenty dollars an hour. Dan and I have never been sailing before but it does not look hard. We decide to have a go. We put on life jackets, pay the man and push the catamaran out into the water until we are waist deep. Dan jumps onto the boat and then I join him. I take the tiller, the wooden stick you steer with, and the main sheet. Dan controls the jib. As we set sail, the wind gets up. The sail fills and soon we are speeding out to sea. I never thought a boat could be propelled so fast by the wind. I love the thrill as we skim across the water. I am not aware of the danger we are in until Dan shouts, "I think we should turn back." I attempt to turn the boat around but it continues out to sea. "I think you have to tack," yells Dan, fear in his voice. But I don"t knowhow to tack. Dan tries, but his skills are no better than mine. We panic. We tug on the sails. In the process, the catamaran tips and Dan and I end up in the water with the main sail on top of us. We swim out from under the sail. "I think there is a bit of string you pull to get the catamaran up," shouts Dan. He leans into the boat and grabs a rope and pulls. As if by magic, the catamaran rights itself. But I still cannot get the boat to turn round. As the catamarans on the sand become distant dots, we shout for help and wave our arms in the air. It is not long before two men from the catamaran rental reach us in a speedboat. They drop the sails and tie out painter to the stern of the speedboat. We feel foolish as we sit on the hull of the catamaran and get towed in. But we agree it was fun. Perhaps we should have some sailing lessons before we set sail again!</p>
