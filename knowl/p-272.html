<p>There are many different kinds of art. Photography is one type of art. Photographers take pictures using a camera. Some photographers use film cameras and others use digital cameras. Generally, people start taking pictures as a hobby. To become an expert photographer takes a lot of work. One must learn how to use different methods of taking pictures. A photographer must be very observant of the world. A photographer can take pictures of anything, including people, food, animals, or plants. A photographer may take pictures of anything from weddings to termite swarms! One way pictures can be displayed is in a collage. In a collage, a number of pictures are grouped together. They can be scattered or neat, but it is a very useful way for a photographer to show off his or her work.</p>
