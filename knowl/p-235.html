<p>There was a chill in the air, but Chelsea and Mom decided to go to the beach. They packed a big picnic lunch. Chelsea made peanut butter sandwiches. Mom packed a chunk of cheese, chicken, spinach leaves with ranch dressing, peaches, chips, punch, and chocolate milk. They packed beach chairs, a bat,a ball, a mitt, and a blanket. Mom and Chelsea liked playing baseball in the sand. When they got to the beach, they stertched the blanket out and set the chairs on it.  "This is way too much food for us, Mom! We can?t eat it all,"  exclaimed Chelsea.  "Let's invite some friends,"  chuckled Mom. Chelsea called her pal Blanch. Blanch and her mom met Chelsea at the beach. The children and moms ate a feast as they played and watched the choppy waves in the water.</p>
