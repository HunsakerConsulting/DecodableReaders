Who will go with you?" "I will go alone" says Alissa. "Then I will return to America and make cakes in a bakery." Her class claps and claps. They like that idea! "That is goodAlissa! And I will go visit you in the bakery and watch you make cakes" says Mrs. Rebba. Yucca and Bananas for Pamela Pamela likes plants. She is most interested in plants that she eats.
