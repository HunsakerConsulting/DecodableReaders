<p>Harry lost his moccasins. Harry was so upset. They were his best moccasins. Where could his moccasins be" Harry checked under the bed, but he only found dust bunnies there! Harry checked behind the door. There were no moccasins. Harry yelled,  "Mom, where are my moccasins?"  His mom yelled back,  "I don?t know, Harry! Ask your sister."  Harry knocked on his sister's door.  "Carrie, do you have my moccasins?"  cried Harry. "What is the password?"  asked Carrie. Harry had to think of the secret password.  "CHERRIES!"  he yelled at the top of his lungs. Carrie opened the door, and in her hand she held Harry's moccasins. "They were under my clothes,"  said Carrie. Harry jumped up and down. He was so happy to have his moccasins back!</p>
