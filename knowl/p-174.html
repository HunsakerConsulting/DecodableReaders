<p>Nam Fong went on a trip to Hong Kong. He went on a boat ride to see the sights of Hong Kong. He saw a big container ship. It was attached to a red tug boat. The tug was very strong. He saw a lot of traffic on the road. It was a crush on the train. Nam Fong stayed at the Intercontinental Inn. It had a lot of levels and hundreds of rooms. He went up and down in the lift. All the waiters in the Intercontinental Inn were very polite. "Can I help you?" they said. It was terrific fun. Nam saw a big ship at the dock. It had hundreds of windows and lots of decks. Can you see the life boats" The passengers went to see the markets and sterets in Hong Kong. He went on the underground train and bought all sorts of things at the steret market. Nam was upset when he finished his trip. He will go back to Hong Kong.</p>
