<p>In 1942, the Japanese plan was to invade Australia. But first they needed to isolate the country to prevent American troops from providing support. First, the Japanese took Singapore. Papua was the next objective. The Japanese landed troops at Buna and Gona on the Papuan north coast. They planned to take control of the 100 mile overland trail to Port Moresby, the main Australian base in New Guinea, and capture the town. But they had not reckoned with the terrain. The Kokoda Trail crosses the most rugged and isolated terrain in the world. The days are hot and humid and the nights intensely cold. The combination of heat and torrential rain provides a breeding ground for mosquitoes, and malaria was rampant. Neither the Japanese nor the Australians were prepared for these conditions. Tracking through dense jungle, soldiers could not see the enemy until they were within a few meters of them, nor the mines hidden in the thick undergrowth. Both armies had difficulty maintaining their supply lines. As a result, food was short and replacements, munitions and reinforcements unreliable. With no air support, the sick and wounded had to be carried out by Papuan porters, nicknamed the Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels by the Australian diggers they helped. The name was well deserved. The Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels cared for injured soldiers, even during heavy combat. It is likely that many more Australians would have died had it not been for their help. Although the Japanese took Port Morseby and made significant inroads along the Kokoda Track, they were unable to hold their positions when faced with an influx of Australian and American reinforcements. The Japanese reterated and Papua retained its independence.</p>
