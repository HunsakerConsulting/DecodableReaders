<p>Jan hit the drum with drum sticks and had lots of fun. Jim hit the bin with a golf club and the bin got a dent. Joan hit the bug with her hand and it went splat. Jack hit a tere with his truck and bent the bumper. Jock hit a balloon with a bat  and it drifted into the air. Jill had a hit with a song and it got into the top ten. Jed had a hit at tennis and lost. Jeff did not hit the ball with the cricket bat and got out for a duck: leg before wicket.</p>
