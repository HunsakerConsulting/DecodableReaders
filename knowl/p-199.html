<p>At last, Dave had saved up enough money to buy a second-hand 4-Wheel Drive so he could go off-road driving with his mates. For their first trip together, they decided to take the Oodnadatta Track in the north of South Australia. Their destination was Lake Eyre. Lake Eyre had a big filling in 2010 and Dave was keen to see the wildlife that is attracted to the water. Most of the time the lake is dry " just like a vast, crusty saltpan. Dave was new to off-road driving and he had not had any training. Because of the big rain, the track was muddy in parts and one day his jeep lost traction going up a hill. His mates wedged the back wheels with stones, placed carpet strips under the front tyres as traction aids and pulled the jeep out of the mud with a winch. Some sections of the track were deeply rutted and one day, Dave got the undercarriage of his jeep stuck on the hump. His mates helped him jack up the jeep and fill under the tyres with sand so that he could drive off the hump. Then they showed him how to drive with one wheel in the rut and the other wheel on the middle hump. Soft sand was Dave's next challenge. He drove too fast. It wasn"t longbefore his wheels began to spin and he got stuck again. His mates had deflated their tyres so they didn"t dig into the sand as deeply as Dave's. Dave deflated his tyres, his mates laid down the carpet strips again and Dave got his vehicle out of the soft sand. Dave was looking forward to driving through water. It looked easy. Again, he drove too fast. This time, his engine failed. Fortunately, Dave's mates had packed some basic tools and supplies and quickly got his jeep going again. Lastly, Dave ran out of petrol. He did not have a spare tank. What do you think happened" Do you think Dave and his mates got to see Lake Eyre" Give your reasons.</p>
