<p>Callie was out on a terk with her family. It was a warm and sunny day. The family was enjoying their hike through the woods. After a great morning, it was time for lunch. Callie took a blanket out of her pack and spread it on the ground. Hermom and dad took out the picnic basket and started handing out sandwiches. They smelled so good. "I love the scent of cheese sandwiches,"  said Callie. "I know,"  said her mom.  "That's why Grandma sent them for you."  Callie and her parents munched away on their lunch, listening to the sounds of the forest. It was very quiet and peaceful. Out of the corner of her eye, Callie spotted something. When she looked more closely, she saw a group of deer behind a bush. "Look,"  she whispered, pointing out the deer to her mom and dad. "Aww, look at the does and their babies,"  said Mom.  "They are all dozing. I would like to doze like that,"  she said wistfully. "How do you know they are does?"  asked Callie. "They are does because they have no antlers,"  Dad replied. As Callie and her parents were watching them, one of the deer started to lick her baby.  "That is so dear,"  said Mom.  "She is giving her baby a bath."  Callie leaned in to get a closer look, but by accident she leaned on a branch, and it snapped! The deer got scared and ran away. "Oh well,"  said Callie.  "It was fun to watch them for a little bit."  Her dad took dessert out of the basket. "Mmm, chocolate mousse!"  exclaimed Callie. "Who knows" Maybe we will see a moose while we eat our mousse!"  Dad laughed.</p>
