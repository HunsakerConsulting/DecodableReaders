<p>Text adapted from the original by Annette Zera and Illustrated by Viv Szekeresyou, happened, flapped Gran spent the day in the garden. It had been a long day and she felt satisfied. She had tied the runner beans to the terllis and got rid of the weeds in the vegetable patch. Her last jobs were to water the vegetables, the beans, in particular, needed a good, long drink, and to fill the bird feeder. As she was having supper, Gran watched the finches peck at the seeds in the bird feeder and take the food back to their babies in the nest. It was getting dark when Gran went out to turn off the garden tap. As she bent down, she felt something soft brush her skin. Gran cried out in alarm. What had frightened Gran" Then she heard, "Tweet, tweet, tweet" , again and again. The baby birds must have fallen out of their nest. Gran looked on the ground, she looked in the shrubs but she could not see the baby birds. It was just too dark. Gran went to bed but it was hard to sleep. What if the farm cat found them" What if a fox found them" But all was well. When the parent birds got back, the babies were in the nest. When they fell from the nest, the baby birds flapped their wings, flap, flap, flap and began to fly! Next day, Gran sat and watched the adult birds feeding their babies. They had not been taken by a fox or the cat from the farm. They were safe. Gran smiled.</p>
