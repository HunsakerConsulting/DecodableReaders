<p>Mr Bog Outsmarts Ned When Mr Bog got back, in his hands was a big tin chest. Plonk! He let the chest drop on Ned's hands. "Humbug," went Ned. Bang! Ned's gun went off. Mr Bog was OK. He hit Ned with hisfist. Ned fell. Mr Bog rang the cops. He sat on top of Ned and held Ned's gun at his neck. The cops put hand-cuffs on Ned. They led Ned to the van. Ned did a stint in the clink.</p>
