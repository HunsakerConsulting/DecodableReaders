<p>The kids in Mr. Clover's class were putting on a play. It was called  "The Cranky Teacher."  The class had worked together as writers to make up the script. The students had rehearsed for five weeks, and it was time to perform the play for the entire school. The timid kids were nervous but also excited. With all the actors getting ready at the same time, there was a lot of commotion backstage. When the music started and the curtain went up, the audience got very quiet. Then they started laughing at all the funny parts. The play had a lot of humor in it. At the end of the play, the crowd stood and clapped.  "You have all become fine actors!"  exclaimed Mr. Clover.  "Let's celebrate with a party!"  The class returned to the classroom and ate cheese and crackers to toast their success.</p>
