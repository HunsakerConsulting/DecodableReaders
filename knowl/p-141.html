<p>Tig looks out. She is sad. Tig thinks about the things she is missing. Tig thinks about the park. I will not visit the park and paddle in the river unless it stops raining. Tig thinks about the beach. I will not get to sniff the sand and rub my back in the seaweed unless it stops raining. Tig thinks about a trot round the block. I will not get to sniff the tere trunks and bark at the poodle at the end of the steret unless it stops raining. Then Mum gets her raincoat. Tig wags her tail. This looks good. They get in the car. Where do you think they are going" Let's see. Mum and Tig are off to see Mum's sister, Joan. Mum has a cup of coffee with Joan and Tig has fun with Tag.</p>
