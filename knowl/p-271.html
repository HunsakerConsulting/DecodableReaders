<p>Mr. Bender is a great painter. He likes to paint different things. One of his favorite things to paint is landscapes. He paints wonderful pictures of skyscrapers. He paints them glimmering in the sun. Mr. Bender prefers to paint cities, but sometimes he will paint animals as well. One time, he painted a deer with huge antlers. He also painted a glorious butterfly fluttering in the sky. When he wants to sell paintings, Mr. Bender will show them in a gallery. People will  go to his show and wander around, looking at his paintings. He will converse with the people and try to sell them a painting. If someone buys one, Mr. Bender will deliver the painting to the person's house. He likes to see his paintings on the wall in a home.</p>
