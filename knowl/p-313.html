<p>Homer and Ameer are peers in the same class. Homer and Ameer like to pretend that they lived long ago. "What do you think cavemen did?" asked Homer. "I think they worked hard and played here and there" said Ameer. Homer shook his head. "I think so, too. Let's pretend we are cavemen!" he said. Homer and Ameer set up a cave in Homer's room. Then they began to play. "Oh, dear!" exclaimed Ameer. "I am in fear! I see a big herd of animals headed this way." Homer peered out of the cave they had made. "YesI see the herd!" he said. "Let's run to the rear of the cave to stay safe." Homer and Ameer went to the back of the cave. "Do you hear the herd on its way?" asked Homer. "No" said Ameer. "I think that noise is my tummy. I am hungry!" Paneer Hears Thunder Paneer is studying how people made music years ago. He has been reading about drums. Paneer has learned that some people played tambourines. These instruments make a sound like thunder. Long ago, tambourines were made by stertching animal skin over a rim and stitching it in place. Then disks were put on the sides by the rim. The tiny disks hit each other when the tambourine was shaken. People still play the tambourine today. Tambourines can help keep the beat for singers. Paneer wants to hear a tambourine. His music teacher shows him one. He watches her shake the tambourine. Paneer taps it Write about how near his ear. It does sound thunder sounds like thunder! to you.</p>
