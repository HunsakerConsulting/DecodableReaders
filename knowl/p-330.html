<p>Tad the Bedbug rested. He sat at the end of the bed. To Tad, the bed was as big as Texas. The blanket was an endless land. Tad had rested well. Then he was off to get a snack. He had to dig. He was hungry! He dug past the blanket. He dug until he got to an empty level of the bed. It was full of springs. He crept along a spring. He spotted a pretzel that was lost in the bed. Yum!</p>
