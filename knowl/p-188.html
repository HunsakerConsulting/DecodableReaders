<p>Clarissa is a very big female cockroach, about three centimeters long. She spends all day under the fridge, squeezed up in a narrow crack in the concrete. It's nice and warm, thanks to the heat emitted by the fridge motor. This suits her just fine. And she likes the dark. Now and then, a morsel of food rolls under the fridge and she grabs it. Just one pea can keep her going for several days. Clarissa sometimes attracts male cockroaches and they spend a bit of time together. After that, she lays a bunch of eggs that hatch into baby cockroaches, called nymphs. Clarissa and her babies live together under the fridge until the babies grow up  and go off to find their own homes. One night, Clarissa felt a bit peckish and went out looking for food. You never know what people might leave lying about on the kitchen bench. They also drop crumbs and stuff from the bench top or dining table onto the floor. When there isn"t much on the floor or bench tops, there are the cats" bowls. Being such fussy eaters, cats tend to leave food scraps behind, and there is always water in their bowl. This evening, while she is out on the prowl, the light suddenly comes on and the master of the house appears. Uh oh!  Clarissa is in danger. She makes a quick dash for cover. And I mean quick. She can travel at nearly a meter a second, on her six spiny legs. But she is not quick enough. He spots her. He raises his foot and brings his boot rightdown on top of her. Squelch and it's all over for Clarissa, thecockroach!</p>
