<p>Madeline the ant was tired. She had spent the whole day foraging for food. "Is it time to rest yet?"  she asked Jenna, one of the other workers. "No, we still have more work to do!"  Jenna said. Reluctantly, Madeline got up and helped Jenna and the others to move a huge slice of bread into the nest. Finally, the work day was done. It was time to go to the great hall where the workers would show the queen all the food they had found. The queen was very happy with the job the workers had done that day.  "Your hard work will pay off,"  she said.  "All the food that you brought to the nest will supply enough nutrients for the colony for many weeks. Now it is time to celebrate!"  All the worker ants were overcome with joy at the queen's praise and started to cheer and dance. Before long, Madeline joined in. She was tired but could not resist the fun. She danced with Jenna and all her other friends. She was twirling all around and moving to the beat of the music. She was having such a good time, she did not notice that it was getting very late. Before she knew it, it was after midnight! "It is so late, and I am so tired,"  she said to her friends.  "I can?t believe we danced the whole night away!" exclaimed Jenna. "It sure was fun, but now I must go to sleep!"  Madeline said, trying to stifle a yawn. All her friends agreed it was time for the party to end. They all said goodnight. When Madeline got into bed, she fell asleep immediately and dreamed of her nightof dancing.</p>
