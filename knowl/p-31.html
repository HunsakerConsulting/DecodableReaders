<p>Kim and Ben are running with mum and dad along a track in the forest. They are hot and puffing a lot. They stop for a drink and a rest. Mum and Dad sit on a rock and sip on a drink. Kim and Ben run into the forest. The kids get lost. Ben sits on a stump. "We are lost," he sobs. Kim pats his hand. "Mum and Dad will find us" . "Mum! Dad! Mum! Dad! Mum gets up. "That's Kim and Ben. They must have got lost." Mum and Dad run to the kids. They hug Kim and Ben. Kim and Ben grin.</p>
