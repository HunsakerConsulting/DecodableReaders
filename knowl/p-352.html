<p>Don has a buddy, Dan. They have a tent. The tent is by the sandbox. Don and Dan will camp by the sandbox. Hank has a buddy, Gus. They have a tent as well. Hank and Gus have a tent by the pond. Hank and Gus will camp by the pond. Hank and Gus have a plan. They have a prank. Hank and Gus will carry a bug to the tent of Don and Dan at dusk. "I bet they will run,"  said Hank. "I think they will jump,"  grinned Gus. Dusk fell. Hank and Gus hid the bug in the tent. They hid near the sandbox. Don and Dan sat in the tent. "A bug,"  said Don. "Grab him,"  said Dan. "Got him,"  said Don. They left the tent. Dan and Don fed the bug to their frog. "That prank was a dud,"  said Hank. "Yes, it was a flop,"  said Gus,  "next plan?"  "I have plenty,"  Hank grinned.</p>
