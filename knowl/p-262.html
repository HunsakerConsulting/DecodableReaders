<p>It was a big day for Miss Joy's class. Today was the day they were going on a whale-watching trip. The trip was on a boat. Their guide, Troy, spoke while the boat moved. "You have to be very quiet so that we don?t scare the whales away,"  Troy said. Soon they were in the right spot, and the boat ground to a stop.  "Look over there,"  whispered Troy. The class looked around to where he was pointing and a whale dove under the water! The kids were enjoying the sight of a real live whale. Then they heard an annoying rumbling sound that was like snoring. "Watch this,"  said Troy. The whale blew water out of its blowhole! Soon it was time to go back. All the kids in the class howled at Troy, begging him not to go back and end the voyage.</p>
