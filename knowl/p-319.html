<p>Tim kept pigs. He was resting in the grass by a rock. A man crept up to his pigpen and got in. Jumping up, Tim ran at him. The man put one of the runts in a bag and was back on the grass with one big jump. He ran off, and he was fast! Tim ran to him. He swung a stick to snag the bag. The man ran off with empty hands. Tim had the runt back.</p>
