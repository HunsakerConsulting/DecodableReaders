<p>A ball fell from the back of a truck. With one hop as big as the next, it went from hill to hill. It was fast! It went past a class as they did jumping jacks. It went along a pond with a duck swimming in it. It fell in the mud next to the pond. A hotrod blasted past it. The wind from the hotrod sent the ball up...and back on the truck it fell from.</p>
