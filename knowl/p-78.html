<p>When Flip and Kit visit Gran and Grandpa, they often play dress-ups in the attic. They fossick in Gran's trunk of old evening dresses and tip up Gran's big bag of hats. Flip finds a long, black, backless dress with frills at the bottom and a big, black hat. Kit's dress is dramatic. It is red, has black spots and is held up with straps. Kit picks a red hat and pins it on at an angle. Flip and Kit pretend to be models. Flip struts along the rug in the hall. Her dress drags behind her. Kit wiggles along, holding up her dress with one hand and her hat on with the other. Kit steps on Flip's dress. Flip stops. Kit tumbles into her. As Kit stands up, her dress slips to her ankles.</p>
