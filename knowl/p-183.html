<p>Phil and I are mates. Last Saturday, the pair of us decided to go to the fair. When we got there, Phil dared me to go on a ride that went high into the air. I was scared but I tried not to show it. Up the stairs I went. I got into the chair and did up the belt. A hooter blared and we were off. I was so scared my hair stood on end. I could hardly bear it. I gripped the bar and stared ahead, trying to be brave. At last the ride came to an end and I got off smiling, my hand outstertched waiting for my dare money from Phil. Next we went to sideshow alley. Phil was attracted to the Wild West Archery Stall where a man, wearing a cowboy outfit, was tearing tickets from a big roll and handing them out to contestants. Phil paid for a ticket and was handed a bow and three arrows. With the third arrow, he hit thebull's eye, which meant he could choose a prize. There were large cuddly bears and pandas, fancy dress hats and a square wooden box with tennis balls inside. But what attracted Phil was a funny wig made with purple hair displayed on a life sized foam model. He put on the wig and I glared at him because he looked so silly. But Phil just grinned. Off we went, Phil in his purple wig and me still glaring angrily and pretending I didn"t know him. However, I couldn"t resist a photograph! Finally, we went to the coconut shy to try to win a coconut. I went firstand missed every time. Then it was Phil's turn. He obviously had a flair for it because he knocked a coconut onto the ground with his first ball. When we got home, we cracked open the coconut and shared it.</p>
