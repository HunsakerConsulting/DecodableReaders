<p>Danny spots a string in the grass. He picks it up. There is not an end. He pulls on the string. Still, the end is not there. He pulls and pulls. There is a hat stuck to the string. Danny pulls until the hat is in his hands. What a splendid hat! Danny puts it on. Then he pulls the string. A bag is stuck to the string. Danny pulls until the bag is in his hands. It is full of candy! Yum! Danny snacks on the candy. Then he pulls and pulls. There is a penny stuck to the string. Danny pulls until the penny is in his hand. He puts it in his pocket. Still, there is not an end to that string. It must be endless! Danny pulls and pulls. It gets difficult to pull. Danny pulls extra strong. There is the end. It's in the grip of a dragon! "Scram!" yells the dragon, and Danny runs.</p>
