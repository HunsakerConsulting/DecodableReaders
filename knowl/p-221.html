<p>Here is a picture of "Irish" , an Airedale Terrier, on the day I brought him home. He was 6 months old and was a rescue dog. The family that gave him up had a 2 year old child and the minute I saw him I understood why they could not keep him. He is smart and energetic and a real scallywag. He does behave well but he tries to exert his own will as we interact. Look at that face! You can see the mischief in his eyes! Irish follows me around all day long and loves to go outside. The one thing he is afraid to do is going down the basement steps, so he sits at the top and watches and waits for us to come up the steps. He really wants to go down them but the furnace is down in the basement and when it starts up, it frightens him for some reason. If we come in from outside into the basement he will go up the steps but going down is just a no-no. Here he is, a few weeks after we brought him home, as he waits for me coming up the steps. I brought Irish home in December. It was winter where I live so he had to deal with snow. We had several storms that left us with a good amount of snow and Irish could not get enough of it. He loved to run, romp, chase his ball and roll in the snow. With his fur being so thick and wiry, he would come to the door covered in little snowballs clinging to his legs, his paws and his belly. We found out that we could take a wire kitchen whisk and run it over him, removing most of the snowballs. Of course, he would then try to eat them, as he is a scallywag! He really did love to run and romp in the snow and got very excited to go outside when it was on the ground. You can see from this picture how excited he gets. He is probably 8 months old in these snow photos. In this one he is trying to get me to play rough by doing his fake attacks and running at me. His ears always seem to stand up and he has a really big mouth full of teeth! Below he is running as fast as he can to get the blue ball ahead of him. When he goes that fast, it looks like he is flying. In addition to being full of energy, he is also lazy when he has the chance to lie around in the sun. He prefers the shade when it is hot. When you approach him he usually rolls over on his back to beg to be scratched. This day was nice and sunny and he heard me coming so he raised his head to look. You can see how cute he looks and he knows it. It seems like he is always plotting something to get into! In this photograph, it looks like Irish is keeping an ear out to hear what is going on, but the wind was blowing his ear upright when I took the picture. We had been romping and he was worn out and taking a rest, building up energy to begin again. When in the house, Irish keeps a close watch on anything happening outside. He likes to look out the windows and watch people walk by. Irish thinks he is a tough guy so he barks. In this picture, he was as still as a statue, carefully watching something outside. He was so still and straight he looks like a bookend. Irish was nine months old here. He was starting to look like an older dog but still acting like a little puppy. This photograph was taken in spring. The grass was becoming green again and the weather was getting warmer. The birds that left for winter were returning and other wildlife was on the move. I live on the edge of a wood so we get many animals coming through the yard, like this turtle Irish discovered. Irish had never seen a turtle before and was very curious. He pawed at it and walked around it, trying to understand what it was. I didn"t let him bite it though, as he has so many sharp teeth and very strong jaws. I did not want the turtle to get hurt. We ended up taking the poor creature back to the edge of the woods to let it go. As I said before, Irish can be a real scallywag. He likes to drink out of our fountain when he is outside and gets really sloppy when he does. He gets water all over his face and long whiskers and then it drips as he walks around. Just when you are least expecting it, he likes to come up and give you a big, wet, sloppy kiss. It is sort of like taking a big sponge, dipping it in cold water then putting it up against your face, cold and wet. This is the last thing you see when he sneaks up on you to give you a kiss. Irish is a barrel of laughs and fun all day long. We get up very early and he and I spend most of the day together. Right now he is sleeping and dreaming up some new mischief to get into. He will think of something! That's what scallywags do!</p>
