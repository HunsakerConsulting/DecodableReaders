He likes to sort sticks and run. He likes to swing from his arm. Marty likes to lie under the stars. He likes to play and see the night sky. Marty likes to have fun! Marty must stay far from cars. He needs to live in the forest where it is warm and safe. Marty is a kind ape! Bart Gets a Pet Bart wants to have a pet. He will go and find a pet.
