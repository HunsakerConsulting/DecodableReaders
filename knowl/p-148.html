<p>Kit sits at the kerb, on command. "Piddle, piddle. Quick, quick." Kit pees on command. "Car, car." Kit jumps into the back of the car. She sits and looks out. What do you think she is waiting for" "Bed, Kit." Kit gets into her basket. Do you think she is sad" "Fetch Dog." Kit fetches her toy dog from the garden. This is Dog. Dog is Kit's best toy. Dog was left out in rain and got wet. Dog is drying in the laundry. Kit can respond to lots of commands. She can sit. She can pee. She can jump into the car, she can fetch Dog from the garden and she can get into her basket. But Kit cannot beg. "Kit, beg." Look what happens when Kit tries to beg. She cannot sit on her bottom with her front feet raised in the air. She tries, but ends up standing on her back legs. As you can see, Kit cannot beg. But Tig can. Tig gets a titbit. Good dog, Tig.</p>
