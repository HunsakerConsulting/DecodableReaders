<p>The museum had a very valuable ruby that was missing. Officials thought someone had stolen it, so they asked a detective to help them find it. The detective came in to look for evidence. He dusted for fingerprints and asked everybody questions. He took pictures with his camera. The detective looked for anything that would help him find the ruby. The detective worked for a long time to solve the crisis. Finally, he came to a conclusion. He gathered all the workers in a room. They were silent, waiting for the news.  "It was here all along,"  said the detective.  "It was in the back room, gettingdusted."  The museum head was so happy to have the ruby back, she gave the detective a reward.</p>
