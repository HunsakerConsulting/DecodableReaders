<p>Bob's big wish was to film Australia's top predator, the big croc. He took the train to Darwin and from there a bus to Fogg Dam for the boat trip. Can you see Darwin and Fogg Dam on the map" A boat trip is the best way to see crocodiles, as they swim up to the boat for food and can be seen sitting on the river banks. Crocodiles jump up in the air to get at the food. There are 3000 crocodiles living by the river. This is a shot of a croc soaking up the sun in the mud. After the boat trip, Bob visited a crocodile farm. He saw thousands of crocodiles. Some were in pens and some were in billabongs. This is the pen where the young crocs hatch out from their eggs. In 24 weeks, they will be adult crocodiles. Crocodiles are farmed for their skins and their meat. The skins are used to make products such as handbags, hats, hat-bands and belts. Crocodile is a popular meat that is eaten in Australia and overseas. It tastes a bit like chicken. Bob got his wish and has lots of shots of crocodiles. He intends to load them on Facebook for his friends to see.</p>
