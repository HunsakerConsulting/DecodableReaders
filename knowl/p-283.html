<p>Ants live all over the world. The only places where ants did not always live are Antarctica, Greenland, Iceland, and Hawaii. In these places, ants are an invasive species. This means that they were not always found there. They were brought in from somewhere else. There are thousands of ant species. They are insects that are related to wasps and bees. Ants have three body parts. They are the head, the thorax, and the abdomen. Ants have six legs and a pair of antennae. Most ants are usually red or black, but some other colored ants exist. Some ants are even metallic! Ants live in colonies which can have millions of members. An ant colony has many females, and sometimes there are males present. Some of the female ants are called queen ants. Some ant colonies have only one queen, but there are other colonies that can have multiple queens. The other female ants in the colony are called worker ants. They are smaller than the queen and take care of the queen and her eggs. Male ants are called drones and have a shorter life span than female ants. A queen ant can live for up to 30 years. Ants are very strong animals. They can carry things that are 10 to 20 times their own body weight. When they need to carry things that are too heavy for just one ant, they will work together to move the object. Ants are not solitary animals. They are social because they live together in colonies and work together for the good of the colony.</p>
