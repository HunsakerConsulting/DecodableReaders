<p>Fire has been an important element in the life of men from the caveman times. The caveman made use of fire to keep the entry of his cave safe from wild animals. The caveman rubbed sticks together on stone or a block of wood until it was very hot and it started to spark. The caveman then kept rubbing the sticks, adding fine leaf matter, bark and wood chips until the fibres ignited with a flame and the fire was struck. It was important for the caveman to find wood that didn"t smoke too much. A torch lit with fire could help a caveman establish if an approaching person was a tribe member or an enemy. The caveman collected meat and vegetables to eat. He used the embers of the fire, to cook them. Fire safety is important. The caveman dug a hole for the fire and used stones to stop the wind. This also confined the embers in the fireplace so a wildfire would not start. In winter and at night the fire helped stop the caveman feeling cold. Would men have survived without fire"</p>
