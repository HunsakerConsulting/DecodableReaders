<p>Let me tell you about Mig and Jim. Mig spotted Jim sitting on a bench in the park. He was looking sad. "What is the problem?" said Mig, perching on the arm of the bench. "My dog died," replied Jim and he began to weep. "He was sick and in pain," Jim continued, "and mum said it was not fair to let him suffer. I agreed but I miss him a lot. "I understand," said Mig. "Let's see if I can help." When I say, Boo-, grab the arm of the bench. "Boo-boom." In seconds, Mig and Jim were transported to a garden in the land of the Mugbumps. "There is Blog," said Jim. "He looks fit and well." "Blog is no longer in pain," said Mig. "Think of that, Jim, when you feel sad." With that, Mig went tap, tap, with her golf club on the arm of the bench and, in seconds, Jim was back in the park. Mig had vanished but at that moment, Jim spied a dog, similar to Blog, running across the grass. Jim remembered Blog running in the mugbumps" garden and what Mig had said, and he felt better.</p>
