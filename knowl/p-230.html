<p>Mom likes natural food. She will teach Eve to plant seeds.  "Let's plant some salad greens and beets,"  exclaims Mom. Eve hops to her feet. "Can we plant snap peas, too?"  asks Eve. "Yes,"  says Mom.  "But first, we need to clean up and pick weeds. Then we will plant the seeds."  Eve and her mom plant three neat rows of seeds with ease. They leave to take a rest and drink tea. They are pleased with the garden. Mom says,  "After we pick the plants, we will havea feast at a park. We will eat greens, beets, lean meat, and snap peas. Then we will have peaches and cream. It will be a terat fit for a queen!"</p>
