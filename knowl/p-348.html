What else can Fran be" Fran puts the blanket in the closet. It is a hidden den. She is hidden in the red blanket. She can be a rabbit in a den. The rabbit gets dull. What else can Fran be" Fran pulls the blanket on top of her. The ends hang there as if they are legs. Fran is a big, red daddy-long-legs. She is jumping along as a bug with slim legs. Jump! Jump! The daddy-long-legs gets dull. What else can Fran do" Fran sits on the blanket. It is a sled. Fran bumps along a hill on the sled. Bump! Bump! The sled gets dull. What else can Fran do" Fran puts the blanket on the grass. She jumps onto the blanket. She sits. She naps. She is just a kid on a big, red blanket.
