<p>Almost a hundred million years ago, when Australia was still joined to Antarctica, dinosaurs roamed the Queensland outback. Today, the terrain is open grassland with scattered pockets of scrub. In dinosaur days, it was pine forests, swamps and mudflats. In 1999, David Elliot was mustering sheep when he stumbled on a very big bone. It was the thigh bone of one of Australia's biggest dinosaurs, a 20-meter long sauropod. Three years later, Elliot found the mingled bones of the sauropod Matilda and Banjo, a carnivorous theropod. They had died together, stuck in a billabong. Banjo was a 5 meter long carnivore that looked like a cross between an emu and a goanna, with long, hook-like claws and sharp, serrated teeth. Matilda, a herbivore, was massive. She was about 15 meters long and 20 tonnes. Not far away, you can see the 33 inch footprints of about 150 dinosaurs. Their tracks record the day when a 5 tonne carnivore spooked a mob of smaller dinosaurs. The smaller dinosaurs ran for their lives across long-gone mudflats. The footprints, now set in stone, are a vivid reminder, not just that dinosaurs inhabited our land, but of a particular event, in deep time, that actually happened.</p>
