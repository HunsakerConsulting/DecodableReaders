<p>A lady sits slumped in her seat, seemingly asleep. It is not until the tram arrives at the end of the line, and everyone is getting off, that a man approaches her and realises that she is not alive. He raises the alarm. While the driver shuts the door to keep the remaining passengers in the tram, the conductor runs to a telephone box and rings the police. Detective  Hunter takes the call. "Not another unusual deathon my patch!" he grumbles. "It's the second this month." Hunter jumps into his car with his young constable, Fox. On arrival at the tram terminus they inspect the body. Fox assumes that the lady has died of natural causes but Hunter spots a small red mark on her neck and disagrees. In her handbag, they find an envelope with her name, Mrs Landers, and address. Inside is a letter. The letter, from a Mr Rex Seligman, is a blackmail note demanding that Mrs Landers give him the jewellery she smuggled out of Germany, when she fled in 1936. A photograph is enclosed of Mrs Landers at a ball wearing a dazzling diamond necklace. There is a handsome man of a similar age, at her side. The meeting place is the Stag Hotel, Adelaide, at 5 pm on September 18th. "That's today," remarks Fox. Hunter and Fox interrogate the people from the tram but no-one reports anything unusual except a child who remembers the lady who had been sitting next to the victim and had got off the tram several stops earlier. He describes a middle aged lady wearing a black coat and hat. He had said hello to her and when she responded, he noticed an unusual accent. The body is taken to the lab where it is discovered that the old lady was poisoned, probably by a needle in the neck. So, who is the unknown woman who was sitting beside Mrs Landers for the first part of her tram trip" Hunter and Fox drive to Mrs Landers" house where they are met by thehousekeeper, an affable woman, who left Germany with Mrs Landers. She offers the men a cup of tea and freshly baked cake. She is disterssed to hear that her misterss has died and begins to sob. Hunter asks her to show them to hermisterss's bedroom. A jewellery box sits on the dressing table and when they open it, a beautiful diamond necklace is sitting inside. Mrs Green points to the photograph propped up beside it, the samephotograph as that in the envelope in Mrs Landers" bag. She explains thatthe man in the photo is Rex Seligman, the man who sent the blackmail note. "Wherewere you at 2 pm, today?" Hunter asks Mrs Green. "I"ve been in the house all afternoon," she replies. "I did some baking and was about to have a cup oftea whenyou arrived." As they leave, Hunter sees a black coat and hat on the hallstand. He looks at his watch. There is just enough time to get to The Stag by 5 pm. When Hunter and Fox enter the pub, they see the man in the photograph, sitting at a corner table. They ask if he is Rex Seligman and show him the blackmail note and photograph. "Wherewere you at 2 pm?" Hunter asks. "Here. You can ask the barman," he replies. The barman confirms his story. Although the man has an alibi, Hunter books him for attempted blackmail. With Seligman handcuffed in the back of the car, they head for Mrs Landers" house and park the car a little distance from the gate. As they enter the property, Hunter tells Fox to look in the bin. Fox is walking towards his boss, holding a discarded needle, when they see Mrs Green leaving the house. She is carrying an overnight bag. They stop her. "Where are you going, Mrs Green?" asks Hunter. "Hello, Mr Hunter," she replies, "I"m going to spend the night at my sister's. Mrs Landers" deathhas quite upsetme." "I think not," says Fox as he handcuffs her.Heopens the bag, rummages inside and then takes out a small package, containing a diamond necklace. "I"m arresting you for the murder of Mrs Landers and the theft of a very valuable necklace."</p>
