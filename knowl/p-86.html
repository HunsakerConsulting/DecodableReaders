<p>Tig is attracted to mud like metal to a magnet. Tig has fun in the mud. She loves mud! Tig sees a puddle and sprints off. "Stop Tig" Mum cries." Tig ignores Mum and gallops across the wet grass. Tig jumps into a deep pool of mud. She sniffs. What can she smell" Tig is a mess. Black mud sticks to her coat, feet, legs and tum. Tig lies in the grass. Mum looks at the black mud on Tig's tum, feet, and legs. Her tail looks black, too. Mum soaks Tig in the sink in lots of soap suds to get rid of the mud. Mum dries Tig. Tig is worn out. She lies on a blanket in the sun and sleeps.</p>
