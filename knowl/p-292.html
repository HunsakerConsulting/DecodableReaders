<p>Gail is in bed. Gail is in pain! She may have a broken bone. She fell in a hole and cut her leg. "Gail will be fine" said Dr. May. "But she must stay in bed and rest up." "Stay still" said Gail's mom. "Stop! Do not slide your leg in bed!" Gail gets lots and lots of mail. Gail will stay in bed and rest. Rain on a Sail Fay's home is on a bay. She likes to sail with Dad in May and June. On a Sunday in May, they set sail. Then the rain came. Then the wind came. The wind cut the sail. Dad had to tug on a rope. Dad got them back to the bay. Fay and Dad stay safe!</p>
