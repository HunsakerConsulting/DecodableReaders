<p>Cindy had so many things to do. She had to clean her room, wash the dishes, and practice her dance steps. She did not know how to do so many things at once! Cindy sat at her desk to make a plan. She wrote all the things she needed to do on a huge sheet of paper. She made three columns. In the first column, she wrote  "Clean room."  In the second, she wrote  "Wash dishes."  In the third column, she wrote  "Practice dance."  Next, she wrote a time below each task. By doing this, she identified a time slot so she could finish all her chores. Cindy made a great plan! She even had time at the end of the day to watch a film with her family!</p>
