<p>Water runs in a cycle. A cycle is when the same thing repeats itself. First, water falls from the sky in a rainstorm, hailstorm, or snowstorm, or as sleet. When rain hits the land, it can soak into the dirt or can be runoff that flows into riverbeds, sterams, and lakes. Some precipitation can turn into groundwater. Next, water evaporates from the ground and from bodies of water like lakes and sterams. When it evaporates, it turns into a gas called water vapor. In the next step of the cycle, the gas will change back to water and can make a cloud. When a lot of gas changes back, the cloud will get heavy. This will make rain fall and then the cycle can start over.</p>
