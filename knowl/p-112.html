<p>Ned Gets Out of Jail Ned's band of bandits: Sam, Tom and Pip, concocted a plan to get Ned out of jail. On the allotted day, Sam and Tom went to visit Ned. They got off their horses and tied them to the railing. The jail was surrounded by an open yard with a low railing for tying up horses. As they went across the yard, Sam pretended to have a fit. He fell to the ground and shook his arms and legs. "Help, help!" cried Tom. "My pal is not well." The jailer, who had been standing outside the door of the jail checking the prisoners" visitors as they went in, went to help Sam. When the jailer was not looking, Ned snuck out of the jail. He crept round to the back where Pip was waiting with a horse. The jailer stood up when he saw the horses gallop off and ran after them. He shot at Pip and Ned but they were too far off. While the jailer was running after Ned and Pip, Sam got off the ground and he and Tom got on their horses. Back at camp they met up with Ned and Pip. When the jailer got back to the yard, Sam and Tom had left. "What a fool I am," he said to himself. He plodded across theyard and went into the jailhouse, his gun hanging from his hand. It had been a trick to help Ned get out of jail.</p>
