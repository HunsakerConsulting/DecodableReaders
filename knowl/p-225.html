<p>Ted sat at the pond and filled a big pot with mud. Ted's hands dug in the wet dirt. Drops of mud fell off his hands. Then Ted set a lid on top of the pot and left. When Ted came back, the lid was not there. How did the lid get lost" Is it a trick" Ted spotted mud tracks in the grass and followed them. The tracks ended back at the pond. Ted saw the pot lid. The lid did a big hop! Ted jumped back. He had a plan. Ted set his hand on top of the lid and started to pick it up. A frog with mud on it hopped past Ted. Ted ran and caught the frog and held it in his hands. "Hi,"  grinned Ted.  "Let's make a mud mess!"</p>
