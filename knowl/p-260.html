<p>There are lots of ways to get energy. Most places burn fossil fuels. These fuels will not last. They can make the air dirty, too, so we need to look for new ways to get energy. Using the sun is a clean way to get energy. The name for this is solar power. People can use panels on top of their homes to catch the sun's rays. The sun's energy can be changed to electrical power and can also be used for heat. We can get clean energy from the wind, too. A lot of space is needed for wind power. A group of windmills needs to be set up to catch the wind. Water is also a way of getting clean energy. Running water can spin huge wheels. This energy can be changed to many other kinds of energy for use by people.</p>
