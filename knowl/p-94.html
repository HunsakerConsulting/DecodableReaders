<p>Aiden and Adam and their mum and dad went to the zoo. They had seen the zoo's baby elephant on TV. It was sweet and they wanted to see it when it was still little. They went to see the pandas, the zebras, the hippopotamuses, the gorillas and the elephants. But they did not get to see Tuk Ta, the baby elephant. Tuk Ta was sick and was kept hidden from the public with Porntip, her mum. Aiden and Adam were sad. To cheer them up, their mum and dad took them to the children's zoo. In the children's zoo, there are animals that you can pick up, pet and cuddle. They are domestic animals, such as sheep, goats, pigs and rabbits. Aiden patted a sheep and fed a goat. Adam sat on a bench and held a rabbit on his lap. Then Adam cried out, "Mum, my pants are wet. Look. The rabbit did it. I did not wet my pants. The rabbit just peed on me." Adam handed the rabbit to his mum. The children and their parents left the children's zoo and went to the kiosk for a drink. The sun was hot and dried Adam's pants. Soon, he had forgotten that the rabbit had peed on him and was having fun on the swings.</p>
