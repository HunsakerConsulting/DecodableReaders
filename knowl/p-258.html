<p>Billy was stuck with his baby sister. She was crying so loudly, it was the noisiest sound he had ever heard! He tried to makeher happy by waving her stuffed bunnies around for her, but she just cried and cried. He needed to do something to make her stop! Suddenly, he had an idea. Maybe if he wore a disguise, she might start smiling. Billy reached into the kitchen drawer and pulled out a big paper bag and some markers. He made a funny face with lots of colors and cut out two holes in the bag for his eyes. When he finished, he placed the bag on his head and went over to his sister. At first, she cried harder, but then she stopped and stared at him. Then she started to giggle like it was the funniest thing she had ever seen!</p>
