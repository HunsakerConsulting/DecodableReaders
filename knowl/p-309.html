"Little wren, what are you doing here?" asked Gnalla. The wren stopped and looked at Gnalla. Then it began pecking at the dirt. "I know what you are doing!" exclaimed Gnalla. "You are eating gnats!" The wren looked at Gnalla again. Gnalla got some seeds. She took the seeds and dropped them on the ground. "Here, little wren" she said. "Come and eat the seeds!" Then Gnalla gave the wren some crumbs. "Tweet!" yelled the wren as it flew away. Gnalla grinned. "It is a sign that it will be a good day!" she said. Mr. Wrago's Wrench Mr. Wrago owns a plumbing company. He helps people when the pipes around their homes don?t work. The phone rang. "Wrago Plumbing" he said when he picked up the phone. "This is Mrs. Knop. I need help!" she wailed. "My sprinkler is leaking! I worked hard to stop it, but my thumb got numb and my muscles started to hurt." "Don?t fretMrs. Knop" he said. "I will be right there!" Mr. Wrago got into his plumbing van and drove to Mrs. Knop's house. Mrs. Knop met him in the driveway. Mr. Wrago got his wrench and started to work.
