<p>Bugalugs Jim sat on the bed and wept. "Cheer Up, Bugalugs," said Mum. "Cheer Up, Bugalugs," said Dad. Jim was at the doctor's clinic. He had a bad cut on his leg and cuts on his hands. "You will be OK soon," said the doctor. But Jim was still sad. You see, Jim is the goalkeeper for his footballteam and he will miss the big match. He will have to sit on the bench. Jim's team wins the match and Jim, too, gets a medal. His mum and dad cheer. "Good on you, Bugalugs."</p>
