<p>On this particular morning, Pedro got up with the sun, scoffed his breakfast and ran out the door, shouting behind him that he was off to see Alberto. Mum yelled, "It's too early to visit friends!" But Pedro was out of earshot. He was on his way " across the plaza, past the church" and was nearly around the arena when he saw a ripple of red cloth above the wall. He stopped in his tracks, then took three steps back to get a better look. His eyes darted around the top of the wall. There it was again, almost out of sight. If only he could get a better view. Pedro scanned the outer wall of the arena and saw some jutting stones that he might be able to use as steps. He looked over his shoulder to see if anyone was watching, but there was no-one in sight. The "steps" were easy as his feet were little, but it was hard to find good hand holds. At last he reached the top of the wall and looked down on the arena. He could see it all. But he was disappointed. There was no matador and no bull. He was hoping madly that the red cloth had been real and not a trick of the morning light. The minutes passed. He looked around. Still no-one seemed to have seen him. "Snort." Pedro turned back to the arena and there it was " a huge bull. And then the matador entered the arena waving his red cloak. Pedro watched the man and marvelled at his skill. He believed he could stay all day and not get bored. As the sun came round to Pedro's side of the arena, it beat down on the back of his neck. The matador quickly looked up and made eye contact with Pedro. It nearly cost him his life. The bull's horn must have missed his side by millimeters. Pedro gasped and his eyes almost popped out of their sockets. The matador did not look at him again but worked until the sweat was pouring down his face. Then, without warning, the matador ran out of the arena and was gone. Pedro was sad that it had ended so suddenly. Before climbing down, he gazed into the arena, dreaming of being a matador when he got older. He was imagining the cheering of the crowd as they watched Pedro, the grand matador, when he heard, "Hey, kid!" This snapped him back to the present and, scared that he was about to be told off, Pedro turned timidly to face the voice. Pedro nearly fell. The voice was coming from the matador, who was still dressed in his garb and smiling up at him. Pedro quickly jumped down to say hello. Alberto  told Pedro that he had seen hisshadow in the sand and that was what made him look up. And then he invited Pedro and his family to his next fight as his personal guests. Pedro ran home, grinning from ear to ear. "How is Alberto?" asked his Mum. "He's very brave," replied Pedro.</p>
