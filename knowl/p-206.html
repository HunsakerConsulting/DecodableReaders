<p>A yurt is a portable home that has been used for thousands of years by Mongolian nomads. Many Mongolians live in yurts. They are very practical because when a family's herds have eaten all the grass near their yurt, they can dismantle it, pack it up, put it on a camel or yak and go to a new spot. The design of a yurt is clever and construction only takes about two hours. The walls are made from wooden struts and the roof has wooden rafters, tied together with rope made from camel or yak hair. To keep the occupants dry and warm, the rafters are covered with layers of fabric and felt, made from sheep's wool. In the middle of the roof is the crown. Because yurts do not have windows, the crown is very important. It is the Mongolians" equivalent of an air conditioner as parts of it can be opened and closed to let in more, or less, fresh air. Look at all the mod cons some nomadic Mongolians have today. They have a solar panel to heat water, a satellite dish for TV and a generator for power. Some families have a yak cart to ride in. Others have camels, motor bikes or trucks. Living in a yurt suits a nomadic way of life but even in towns and cities, some people live in yurts. Just as there are rich houses and poor houses, there are rich yurts and poor yurts. But, one thing is common to all yurts2 you have to keep them tidy because there is not much room. Rich families have TVs and fridges, tables, seats and beds. In the poorer yurts there are no beds or seats and family members sit and sleep on the floor. The stove is very important. It is used for cooking and to heat the yurt. Like a combustion heater, the smoke goes up the flue and into the air outside. Most parts of Mongolia are tereless and people use camel dung instead of wood. Camel dung keeps the flies away and makes a good fire for cooking on. When there is little grass left for the animals to eat and a family has to move, they do not sell their "house", they take it with them. First, they take all their belongings out of the yurt and then they dismantle it. Everything, including the kid goat, is packed onto the back of a yak, a camel or truck. Mongolian nomads move at least twice a year but they don"t travel far. In spring, they go to areas with good, open pasture where their herds can graze. At the beginning of winter, they go to camps that are naturally sheltered from the wind by mountains and have barns for the animals to shelter in at night.</p>
