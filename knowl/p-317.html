<p>Dan was in his tent at camp. He had a sudden cramp in his leg. He sat up to rub it. The rest of the men in the camp slept. Crickets sang. The wind hit the tent. Dan was hungry. Dan got up. He drank from his cup. He had eggs and a bit of ham. The sun crept up. It lit the hills. Dan was glad. The rest of the men got up, and the elk hunt was on.</p>
