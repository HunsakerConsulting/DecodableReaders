<p>It was Sunday morning, and Kat's family was eating breakfast. Her dad was reading the headlines in the newspaper when he suddenly pointed out a flying show that was going on today. "Would you like to go?"  asked Kat's dad. Kat nodded happily.  "Oh, yes!"  exclaimed Kat.  "I love planes!"  "Well, then, go get ready quickly, because the show starts in an hour!"  said her dad. Kat and her parents got to the show just in time. The performance was about to begin. They all waited excitedly for the first plane. Kat heard rumbling and watched the plane climb upwards. Soon it was over her head! It was quickly joined by three other planes. The sound was so loud, she jumped! "Don?t worry, Kat,"  her mom yelled over the noisy planes. Kat and her family watched the planes. They did many incredible tricks in the sky! When the show was over, Kat wanted to see the planes on the ground, so her parents took her over. When Kat saw the planes up close, she was in awe.  "Your plane is so graceful,"  she said to the pilot. "Thank you,"  the pilot said.  "Would you like to become a pilot some day?"  she asked. "Is it hard work?"  asked Kat. "Yes, but if you stay persistent, you will become universally known,"  she said. Kat beamed happily at the pilot. It was her dream to become a great pilot! The pilot gave her a packet. It was full of papers she could fill out to gain membership to the Junior Pilot's Club. It was getting cloudy, and her parents wanted to go before the rain started. Kat shook the pilot's hand and thanked her for being so helpful. Kat couldn?t wait to get home to start filling out her membership papers!</p>
