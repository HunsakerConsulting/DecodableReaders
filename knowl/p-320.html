<p>Gus hid in the grass. He had run from a goblin. To the left of him was a rusted cannon. Fog hung over the flat lands by the hills. The goblin had hunted Gus in the hills. He had hunted Gus along the flat lands. Gus felt a strong tug on his leg. The goblin was upon him! It cast a spell. Gus felt the spell hit him. The cannon was big. The grass was big. Gus was soft and fluffy. He was a rabbit!</p>
