<p>Tig has realised that she can be seen from a long way off because of her white coat. This means that she is easily spotted when she is doing things her mum and dad don"t like. Tig plans to camouflage herself so she cannot be seen. Today, she experiments with wet sand. She reckons a thick coat of wet sand willbe good! "I"ll blend in quite well," she thinks. "I don"t think they"ll see me sniffing the horse poo!" Tig's next idea makes sense to her but not to us! Why is she mistaken" Tig digs a hole and sticks her nose in the ground. "You can"t see me now," thinks Tig, as she tries to dig out the ball she has found. Yes, we can. "But I can"t see you." "Mmmmm!" Next, Tig considers ways of covering herself so that she can roam unseen. There are different sorts of seaweed on the beach. Maybe she could disguise herself as a mound of seaweed. "Is it better to drape myself in the black seaweed or the tan seaweed with the bubbles?" she asks herself. Tig's next idea is interesting. This is her thinking. Maybe I can pretend to be a person. My mum and dad wear jackets and sit on settees. My mum and dad are people. If I have my jacket on and sit on a settee, then I will look like a person, too" Why is Tig's idea incorrect" Since Tig's ideas so far have not saved her from getting told off, shedecides that it might be better to try to blend into the natural environment. She looks for an environment that looks like her. Could you spot Tig against the white sand of the beach" "If I walk slowly and don"t look back, perhaps they won"t see me disappear into the cliffs." "Or I could blend in with the crowd. Which dog do you think is me in this photo?"</p>
