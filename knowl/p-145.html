<p>A codling moth lays an egg on an apple leaf. As soon as the egg hatches, the grub tunnels into a nearby apple. The apple is picked. Then the apples are sorted and packed into boxes. The boxes are stacked in a refrigerated container. The container is loaded onto a ship. When the ship docks, the container is lifted onto a truck. The truck delivers the boxes of apples to market. The apples are set out for sale. What do you think happened to the grub"</p>
