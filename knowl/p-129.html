<p>Tim wants to go on a fun run with his kids but he needs to get fit. He runs. He swims. He jogs. He skips. He gets fit. It is the start of the run. Bang! Tim and the kids set off. The kids are good runners and Tim cannot keep up with them. The kids wait for him at the end. They clap, and pat Tim on the back, when he gets to the finish. "Good on you, Dad!" they exclaim. Tim grins. He flops onto the ground. He's had it!</p>
