<p>Mr. Thrain's class strained to hold their hands high so they would be picked to read their report. It was Henry's time to read.  "Please read your paper to the class,"  said Mr. Thrain. Henry felt a lump in his throat and his heart throb. He could not help thinking about what a strict critic Mr. Thrain could be. Henry began to read. "China is in the East. It has a rich heritage. In the past, China was ruled by dynasties. China has many farms. The people grow crops like rice and wheat. Rice grows well when the land is wet. An animal represents each year in China. I was born in the year of the rabbit."  Henry finished reading. The class sprang to their feet and clapped. "That was great, Henry,"  said Mr. Thrain.  "Maybe one day you will take a trip to China."</p>
