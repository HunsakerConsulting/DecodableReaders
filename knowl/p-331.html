<p>Jed was at the melon stand. The man at the stand handed Jed a nut. "Plant this nut," he said. "A red poppy will spring up. Then it will ask you to bring it a drink." Jeb planted the nut in his sandbox. By sunset, a big, red poppy was there. "Can I get you a drink?" Jeb said. "Yes," said the poppy. "And put a twist of lemon in it!"</p>
