<p>Danny was at the spring festival. He had a prank to pull. He had a jug of milk with its cap off. He put the jug on top of the big boxes by the band stand. Danny put a string on the milk jug. He hid, and held the string. The band was setting up. Danny's plan was to tip the milk on the band. But the milk fell on Danny! It got him wet!</p>
