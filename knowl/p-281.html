<p>Wilbur and Orville Wright were obsessed with the idea of flying. When they were boys, their father gave them a flying toy. They found the toy irresistible and dreamed of the day when they could make a machine that would let them fly! When Wilbur and Orville grew up, they became bicycle builders. There were countless bicycle shops all over town, but the Wright Brothers? shop was different. Not only were Wilbur and Orville building bicycles, but they were also experimenting with wings. They were going to figure out how to make a flying machine. Many people thought they were foolish, but the brothers were unstoppable. Their first flying machine had a five-foot wingspan. It was too small and unstable to hold a person, but Wilbur and Orville knew that they would be able to use this model in the development of a machine that a person could fly. Finally, in 1903, the Wright Brothers finished their first full-sized flying machine. They called it the Flyer. On December 17, 1903, the Wright Brothers were the first pilots when their Flyer took off from Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, and they flewsuccessfully for 120 feet. Their flight only lasted 12 seconds, but the idea of human flight was now a reality. The impossible childhood dream of Wilbur and Orville Wright had become real. They were the first aviators. They had made history, and their flying machine became a useful tool in developing the airplanes we use today.</p>
