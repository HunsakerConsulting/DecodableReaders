<p>Dad and Ellen have a basket. Ellen and Dad have a blanket. They will have a picnic. "I am hungry,"  said Ellen.  "Can I have a berry?"  "Yes,"  said Dad. "I am still hungry,"  said Ellen.  "Can I have a banana?"  "Yes,"  said Dad. "Are you still hungry?"  said Dad. "No,"  said Ellen.  "Is the basket empty?"  "Yes,"  said Dad,  "and we have no mess. That is a fun picnic!"</p>
