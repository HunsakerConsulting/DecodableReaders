<p>Huntsman spiders have long, hairy legs and can move very fast. They have 8 eyes. Some huntsmen are as big as an adult's hand. Unlike most spiders, huntsmen don"t spin webs. Sometimes, they come into houses and sit on walls and ceilings, waiting. What are they waiting for" Huntsman spiders eat cockroaches, earwigs and other bugs, sometimes other spiders. When a bug gets close, they grab it and inject it with poison to liquidise its insides. Later they will drink the liquid. In the rainforest, there is a huntsman that has a grey or brown back and a green belly, so it blends perfectly with the teres on which it lives. Harry is one of these huntsmen. Small jumping jack ants also live in the rainforest. They have sharp mandibles and a sting in their tail that can deliver powerful venom. They are very agile and can jump from branch to branch. They are quite fearless. One day Jenny, a jumping jack ant, spots Harry. Jenny normally eats nectar from flowers but when she sees Harry, she thinks he will make a good meal for the larvae in the nest. She jumps onto the spider. Harry grabs the ant and sinks in his fangs. But before she dies, Jenny stings the huntsman, partly paralysing it with her venom. Jumping jack ants at the nest hear the noise and run to help. The ants work as a team, attacking the spider from all sides. Within seconds, Harry is dead and the ants drag his lifeless body to their underground nest to provide food for the larvae. In the world of ants and spiders, ants in the large numbers will always win.</p>
