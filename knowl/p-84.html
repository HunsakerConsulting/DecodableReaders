<p>It is hot and Bim, Jed and Todd are at the dam. Jed and Bim paddle. Todd grabs the rope hanging from the gum tere. As he swings into the air, he spots a big log, floating in the middle of the dam. Todd lets go of the rope and drops into the dam. He has plans for the log. He will pretend it is a boat. Todd drags himself onto the log. He is content on his boat. Jed sees Todd sitting on the log and swims across to him. Up he jumps onto the log. Todd grins. "Wait for me," cries Bim, as he swims to the log. Jed grimaces. Bim grabs the end of the log. He tries to lift himself onto the log. But the log sinks. Jed and Todd topple into the dam. The kids swim to the bank. Todd reflects on his "boat" as he sees it bob up to the top, a log again, floating in the middle of the dam.</p>
