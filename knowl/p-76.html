<p>The kids set off for a picnic: Brad, Pip, Ben and Ben's dog, Wags. Brad and Pip went on the swings. Ben and Wags went to the pond. Ben fell in the pond. Wags bent to help Ben but Ben was too big for the dog to lift. Wags went to get Ben's pals. The kids lifted Ben out of the pond. Ben was wet. So the kids had to miss the picnic.</p>
