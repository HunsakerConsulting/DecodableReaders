<p>Claire is writing a story about a princess named Flair. Princess Flair had long hair. She spent most of her days sitting in a chair. She ruled the kingdom of Udair from her chair. Her large pair of princess slippers didn?t fit well. She had a magic wand in the shape of a star. One dayPrincess Flair tripped on her princess slippers and fell down the stairs. "Oh, no!" she wailed. "I dare say I have a big cut on my arm!" She was far from a doctor, so she waved her magic wand. "I wish for no scar and princess slippers that fit!" she whispered. SuddenlyPrincess Flair's slippers were just right, and her cut had vanished! The princess was so happy, she? Claire stopped writing. "What should Princess Flair do next?" she wondered. Sar's Tar Mark was given a journal. In it, he wrote about a make-believe city called Par. In the land of Par, tar was rare. Every year, the people of Par searched for tar. Those who found tar made great things. Those who did not find tar had to wait until the next year. The best tar finder was Sar. He found tar in strange places, like a lion's lair. Sar would put a jar by each place he went to look for tar. When he found tar, he would put it in the jar. Sar had searched for tar since he was little. He had memories of finding tar as a child. He even remembered where he had found the tar! Sar built roads with the tar. The people from Par loved Sar because he shared!</p>
