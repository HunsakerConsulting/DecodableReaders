<p>A Tig Story Tig steps on the sand. You can see her foot prints. She sniffs at the wet sand. She jumps up onto a big rock. Tig runs on the rocks. She jumps from rock to rock. She grabs the duckweed with her teeth and tugs at it. Then Tig gets up onto a big rock. She sits on the top of the rock and looks at the ground. It is a big jump onto the sand. Do you think Tig will jump" Tig is smart. She waited for mum to pick her up.</p>
