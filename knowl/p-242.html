<p>Bob and Dan are going to make a go-cart. It was Bob's idea to make it, but Dan has many things for building and is very handy. They got a plan for the go-cart from the hobby store. It is a chart and is hard to read, but Bob and Dan figure it out. They work on the go-cart all morning. Soon it is lunch time. Dan's mom made a spinach and cheese tart for lunch. "You are not getting into mischief with that cart?"  asks Dan's mom. "No, Mom, of course not!"  says Dan. Bob and Dan eat and go back to the go-cart. It takes the rest of the day to put the parts together, but they finish! Bob and Dan can?t wait for the weekend when they can try it.</p>
