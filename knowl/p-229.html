<p>Pete is on a journey. He needs to flee the heat of the sterets and see green leaves and teres. Even under the teres, Pete feels the heat of the sun. He is thrilled to see a creek. Pete slips into the creek and is pleased to be in the sweet, clean sweep of the cool water. Pete feels a snail under his heel just as a breeze sweeps past his cheek. His hair begins to stand on end at the feel of the sleek snail and the cool air. Pete cannot breathe. He hears wildlife a few feet away. Pete hears feet: big feet!  "Please let it not be a real beast,"  pleads Pete. The steps come near. It is Pete's big brother Steve!  "Get out of that creek before you begin to sneeze," teased Steve.</p>
