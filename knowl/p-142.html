<p>Miss Talbot's class is planning a camp. Jack feels bad. He is not keen to go to camp. "Are you OK?" Bill asks. "I am OK," Jack lies. Bill tells Miss Talbot that Jack seems sad. Miss Talbot sends Jack to the Sick Room and rings his mum. Jack's mum collects him and asks what the problem is. "I do not want to go to camp," Jack sobs. "I will miss you and dad." "We will miss you, too," replies his mum. She hugs him and Jack attempts a grin. Tips for combating homesickness:" Keep active" Find a pal to talk to and do thing with. It will stop you from feeling bad" Ring or email mum and dad " but not when you feel sad" Cuddle a soft toy" Pack a photo of mum, dad and your pets." Do not lie on the bed and sob.</p>
