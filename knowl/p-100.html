<p>Zog was a top elf. His job was to sort the children's presents. He kept a long list of children and gifts. Zog kept the presents in stacks. There were stacks of gifts for kids under ten and stacks for big kids. Zog got his fork-lift truck and went to lift a stack of presents into Santa's sack but the truck hit the stack. The stack toppled and hit the next stack and that stack hit the next stack and so on. The gifts fell and got muddled up. Zog looked on, helpless. He felt bad. He went to tell Santa. Was Santa cross" No. Santa went to help Zog. Zog and Santa got the gifts back into the correct stacks. Next, Zog and Santa loaded the gifts into sacks and lifted the sacks onto Santa's sled. "Top job, Zog," said Santa with a grin. Off went Santa and Zog to deliver the children's presents.</p>
