<p>Curtis was one big dude. He ate as much food as nine children. His pants were extra large. He was tall as well as wide. The kids on the bus were afraid of Curtis. He was never rude or mean. He was just big. They did not wish to make him angry. Curtis found a way to make the kids his pals. He told them lots of jokes!</p>
