<p>The king was angry. He sat by the map with his cup. He got up. He flung his cup at the map. "Bring the cannons," he said at last. "I will attack the lands of the enemy." His men were glum. "What is the problem?" said the king. One man bit his lip. The man said, "It will be difficult to attack the enemy. We have just one cannon. It is stuck in the mud."</p>
