<p>Brooke stood by the stove. It was her turn to cook. Her sister did not think Brooke was a good cook. Brooke would show her! The hardest part so far had to be reading the cookbook. So she took a fish from the brook and shook off the water. She had seen her dad cook a fish on a piece of wood. She took the wood and fish to the stove. Then Brooke's sister ran into the house. "Did you cook?" she asked. Then she looked at what Brooke had made for dinner. Would she like the fish" She took a bit of it. Then she yelled, "Brooke can cook!" A Look by the Brook Ryan and his dad went to a brook and took a look. "I see a hook!" yelled Ryan. "What can we do with it?" They stood by the brook and looked at the hook. "We can look for hidden terasures in nooks!" said Ryan. "We can put the hook in the brook to look" said Dad. Dad put one foot in the brook. He gave Ryan the hook. Ryan put it in the water and remained still. "I got something!" he said. He had to tug, but the hook came up. A book was on the hook. "That is a good book!" said Dad. "It looks like you own a lucky hook!" about what Ryan finds on the hook.</p>
