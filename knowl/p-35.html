<p>He has a big pig. He picks up the pig and begins to hiccup. Hic! Hic! Hic! Fred sips from the back of a glass to help stop the hiccups. Hic! He has a hot drink. But still, he hiccups. He gets tickled. Hic! Giggle. Hic! Giggle. Hic! Fred sticks out his tongue and tugs on it. Hic! Hic! Hic! He puffs into a bag but the hiccups do not stop. Then, one day, Fred got up and the hiccups had gone. Fred had had hiccups for a hundred years.</p>
