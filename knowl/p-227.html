<p>All snakes have scales, shed skin, and do not chew food. Snakes can use belly scales to move. Most snakes lay eggs. Snake skin can be bright. Snake skin can be pale and dull. A snake that has dull skin can help itself from getting eaten because it blends into its habitat. A snake may make a home in a cave, by a lake, in sand, and in grass. It can be a pet. You may spot a snake if you rake. It may be tame. It may cause pain. Take care and wait for help to relocate a snake. It is fun to gaze at a snake, but it is risky to lift it. We must not hate snakes. Snakes are not tame, but stay from harm's way and you will stay safe.</p>
