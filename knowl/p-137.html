<p>A lot of cats hate getting wet. They hate the rain. They hate sprinklers. But Stan is different. Stan loves water. He likes to get wet and he likes to drink water. One day, when Jill got home, the bathroom and Stan were wet. What do you think happened when Jill was out" Jill thinks Stan tried to drink the water in the toilet and fell in. Then, as he scrambled out of the toilet, water went everywhere.</p>
