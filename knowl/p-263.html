<p>Coral reefs are found in warm, shallow salt water where the current is calm. They start out small and can grow to be very large. They are like a mall of living things sprawled across the sea floor. They are home to plants such as seaweed and animals including crabs, sea urchins, sponges, sea turtles, and all different kinds of fish. Dolphins sometimes pause in a reef to eat. Coral looks like a plant but is actually an animal. There are many kinds of corals that come in an array of colors like red, pink, orange, and green. Some corals are hard while others are soft. The soft corals can move with the waves. Many reefs are being destroyed by humans, so it is important to protect them.</p>
