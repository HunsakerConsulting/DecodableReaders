<p>Todd is a big black train. Todd transports the mail to the port of Dundee. The mail boat to Britain sails at ten o"clock. Todd must not miss the boat. Todd huffs and puffs as he struggles up the hills. Todd beeps his horn as he speeds across the plains. "Beep, beep!" At a crossing, Todd sees a goat on the track. He beeps his horn but the goat just stands still. Todd has to stop and wait for the goat to get off the track. "Beep, beep, beep, beep!" How is Todd feeling as he waits" Will he to the port of Dundee before the boat sails" It is ten o"clock. Todd is at the dock. The mail is loaded on the boat and the boat sets sails. "Boom, boom," booms the boat's fog horn. "Beep, beep," Todd replies.</p>
