<p>Whales are mammals that live in the sea. They have fur and lungs like all other mammals. They are found in oceans all around the world. Whales can breathe underwater using ablowhole. They have fat which keeps them warm in cold waters. Whales use many unique sounds to communicate with each other in the sea. Some whales have teeth, and others have baleen to help them eat. Baleen is a fringe in the mouth of a whale that helps it trap food. It is sometimes called whalebone. Baleen whales are massive in size and have two blowholes. Humpback and blue whales are two kinds of baleen whales. Toothed whales are usually small and have one blowhole. Dolphins and beluga whales are types of toothed whales.</p>
