<p>Ned and the Hold-Up Ned was free again but his band of bandits was skint. They had no cash for food and took chooks from farmyards. The bandits roasted the chickens on a spit. They put damper in a tin to cook, in the coals. They could not afford beer and drank the water from the creek. They were glad Ned was back and supported him when he told them his plan for getting rich. Ned had been thinking about it when he was in jail. The plan was to rob a coach. Ned, Pip, Sam and Tom hid at the back of derelict shed by the main road and waited for a coach. They waited and waited. Clip, Clop! Horses. A coach was approaching. It held six men. "Go," instructed Ned. Sam, Tom and Pip mounted their horses and shot at the men in the coach."Bang, bang, bang," went their guns. But the men in the coach shot back. They were protected in the coach. The bandits were out in the open. They could not win. Sam, Tom and Pip fell to the ground pretending they had been shot. Ned fled to the hills. The men in the coach did not suffer harm and the coach continued along the road. It was dark when Ned went back to the camp but when he got there, the sheriff was waiting for him. The sheriff put handcuffs on Ned and escorted him back to jail. As the boss of the band of bandits, punishment would be his. Sam, Tom and Pip were still free. Would they hatch a plan to help Ned get out of jail"</p>
