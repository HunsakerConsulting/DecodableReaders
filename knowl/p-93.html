<p>Frank, Alec and Harrison are having fun at the dam. Frank jumps from the gum tere into the dam and swims to a floating log. He gets up onto the log. Alec jumps from the gum tere into the dam and swims to the log. He sits on the log with Frank. They use their hands as paddles and propel the log along. Then Harrison jumps into the dam. He tries to get onto the log but the log sinks. Frank and Alec wobble and fall off the log. It's a good thing the children can swim!</p>
