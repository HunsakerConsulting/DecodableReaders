<p>Ann and Pam set up a picnic on the sand. They sat on a rug and had snacks and drinks. Ants ran on the sand. The ants crept into the packet of crisps and the packet of nuts. Ants crept onto the melon. The ants crept into the drinks. Ann hit the ants with her hands but she did not get rid of them. Pam stamped on the ants but she did not get rid of them. Ann and Pam had set up the picnic on an ant nest. They had to pack up the picnic and dump the crisps, nuts, melon and drinks in a bin.</p>
