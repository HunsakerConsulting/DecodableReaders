<p>A lot of kids dream of being an astronaut. It is a fine job. It takes a lot of drive and time to train to be an astronaut. It is wise to do well on tests and be at the top in your grade. You must take pride in your work and be a team player. A lot of astronauts can fly planes and jets. They will train for flight in space. They will ride miles high into the sky inside a rocket. On a flight, they can glide and rise just like a kite. To see a night sky from space is quite a terat. If you might like to fly in space, study a lot. You might find yourself high in the sky!</p>
