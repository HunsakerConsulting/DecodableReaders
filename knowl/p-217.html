<p>The kings and queens who ruled Ancient Egypt were called pharoahs. When they died, they were buried in giant pyramids or secret tombs with all their belongings, because Egyptians believed they would need their belongings in the afterlife. Many pharoahs were buried in the Valley of the Kings. Tutankhamun, "King Tut" for short, is probably the best known pharaoh because his tomb was found with everything still in it, completely untouched. All the other tombs had been raided, and the gold and jewels stolen, by grave robbers who tunnelled their way into the pyramids using flares to provide light. Howard Carter, who had spent his life exploring historical sites in Egypt, was convinced that there was at least one more tomb in the Valley of the Kings: the tomb of King Tutankhamun. He was right. But it took his team over four years to find it. Carter's Expedition was funded by Lord Carnarvon who, after four fruitless years, was ready to give up on it. But Carter persuaded him to finance the dig for one more year. In November 1922, Carter found some steps which he was convinced would lead to the tomb. Carnarvon hurried over from England and watched on as Carter chiselled a small hole in the door way and with the light of a candle peered inside. "What can you see?" Carnarvon asked, to which Carter replied, "Wonderful things!" When Howard Carter discovered King Tut's tomb, he found a huge chamber with four rooms filled with everything the king would need in the afterlife: beds, chariots, games, valuable artefacts, walking sticks , clothes, bows and arrows, even food. In one room was a stone coffin that contained three smaller coffins, one inside the other. The two outer coffins were made of wood, covered in gold foil and intricately carved. One was inlaid with coloured glass and semi-precious stones. The innermost coffin contained the mummified remains of King Tut's body. A fabulous death mask in the image of the dead man covered the face of the mummy to make sure that his spirit would recognise him in the afterlife. The innermost coffin and the death mask were made of gold. Carter's find was the most significant discovery for many years. At the time, it was one of the two tombs that had been found as it was when the tomb was sealed more than 3000 years before.</p>
