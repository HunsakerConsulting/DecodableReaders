<p>As Tim rested in the grass by a rock, a man crept to his pigpen and got in. Jumping to his feet, Tim ran at him. The man put one of the runts in a plastic sack, flung himself from the pen, and set off at a fast run. Tim got to him, and swung a stick to snag the plastic sack. The man ran off with empty hands, and Tim had the runt back.</p>
