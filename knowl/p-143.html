<p>It is Sunday and I"m going sailing. With a packed lunch and my sailinggear in a bag, I set off to catch a bus to the sailing club. I eat my lunch on the bus. At the sailing club, I put on my sailing gear and a life jacket and smear sunscreen on my skin. Then I seek out Adam who looks after the boats. He tells me to take Quick Silver, a topper tied to a pontoon. I clamber in, pull on the main sheet to raise the sail and sit on the bench at the stern. Adam unties the painter, tosses it into the boat and pushes the boat out with his foot. I"m off, the main sheet in one hand and the tiller in the other. The sail fills and the boat speeds into the main channel of the river. "I love sailing so much." I feel the wind in my hair and on my cheeks and bask in the feeling of freedom.</p>
