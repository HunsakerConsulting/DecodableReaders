<p>Sid dug a pit in his sandbox until he struck a metal object. It was red, with a lot of rust on it. He dug at it until he got it up from the sand, and dusted it off. It was a tin box, and in it was a lump packed in fabric. With the fabric off, the lump was a glass hippo with a trumpet in its hand. Sid set it next to his bed.</p>
