<p>The president of Kadistan is kidnapped. Dan, a press cameraman, and Mick, his Kadistani assisstant, are sent to report what happens. Snap, snap, snap. Dan sits at a desk, his camera in his hands. He is tense. Mick is late. Tap, tap. Is it Mick? A man steps in and attacks Dan. Dan resists. The man hits him. Dan pretends to pass out. As the man picks up the camera, he trips and Dan hits him with a lamp. Dan rams his camera in his backpack and sets off at a sprint. As Dan hits the steps, Mick skids to a stop. Dan sits back. It is the end of his trip. He naps.</p>
