<p>The robin rested in the nest. It put its wings and soft belly upon its eggs. The robin had put twigs and grass in the nest. They were set in mud. In the nest was a snug spot to be. The wind hit the top of the elm. But the robin kept resting. The nest was snug. The sun set. It got dim. The robin felt an egg jump.</p>
