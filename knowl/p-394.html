<p>Danny had a plan to pull a prank at the spring festival. He sent his buddy Pip to put a gallon of milk, with its cap off, on top of a stack of boxes by the band stand. Danny put a string on the milk jug, and hung it past a spot that he hid in. As the band set up, his plan was to dump the milk on them, but the milk slid and he just got himself wet.</p>
