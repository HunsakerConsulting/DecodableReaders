<p>A fossil is what is left behind by an animal or a plant that lived in the past. Nonliving things do not leave fossils behind. Fossils can tell us something about how the animal or plant lived. There are different ways that fossils can form. Sometimes, when a living thing dies, it can get buried underneath mud. Over a long period of time, it can become a fossil. The hard parts like bones, teeth, and shells are most likely to become fossils. Another way a fossil can form is if a plant or animal gets preserved in ice or tere sap. The tere sap gets hard and turns into amber. Some animals will leave behind footprints that get fossilized. This is called an imprint. Leaves can also leave imprints. You can see the outline of the leaf in the imprint. A paleontologist is a scientist who studies fossils. He or she will spend a lot of time digging for them. When a paleontologist unearths a fossil, it is very exciting. Sometimes it will be an animal or a plant that was previously undiscovered. Fossils can give paleontologists clues to the past. Sometimes, fossils are found in unexpected places. For example, a fossilof an animal that lived in the water might be uncovered on a mountain. The place where this fossil was found must have been covered by water in the past. Earth does not remain unchanged over time. An area that is a desert or mountain in present day might have been part of the sea in prehistoric times. Fossils can give scientists evidence ofsuch things.</p>
