<p>Cathy's favorite flowers were daisies. She wanted a bunch in her room, but she didn?t know where to find them. Cathy checked in the backyard, but no daisies grew there.  "How can I get daisies?"  she thought. Then she had an idea. She could cutpictures of daisies from magazines and tape them up on her wall. Cathy asked everybody she knew for pictures. When she had a big stack, she started sorting them. Each time she came up with a daisy picture, she cut it out with caution because she didn?t want to wreck it. Pretty soon, Cathy had pictures to cover her entire wall. She taped them up and then admired her pretty daisies. She was the happiest girl on Earth!</p>
