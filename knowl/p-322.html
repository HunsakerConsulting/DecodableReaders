<p>Don went up to his granddad's attic. It was full of boxes and bags. He had to bend to get past them. Then he spotted what he had hunted for. It was a trunk. Don dusted off the cobwebs. He put the lid up. In the trunk was a map with a big, red X on it. Don went off to dig at that spot. He got it! It was a mug that said, "Best granddad on the planet."</p>
