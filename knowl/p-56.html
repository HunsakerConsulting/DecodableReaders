<p>Anton and Brandon are Hillbillies in the class gig. They wear check flannel shirts, overalls and big boots. They sing a song and, tucking their thumbs under the straps of their overalls, they begin to tap to the music. Then, "Ping!" Anton's straps snap. His overalls drop to the floor and he is left standing in his jocks. Anton goes red. He runs off with his overalls at his feet but then he trips and skids and lands on his back. Brandon steps in and lends a hand. He helps Anton up. Anton kicks off his overalls and taps in his jocks. At the end of the act, Anton and Brandon get a big clap from the mums and dads.</p>
