<p>Hayden was so annoyed. She really wanted to go to the dance, but she had nothing to wear. The theme of the dance was  "The Gold Rush."  She had no dresses that looked like they were from the 1840s. She pulled a bunch of dresses out of a carton she had in the back of the closet. "Ugh,"  she said, holding one up.  "This one has too many buttons."  She pulled out another and wrinkled her nose.  "I don?t like this one, either. The color makes me look like a pumpkin!"  She held up dress after dress and didn?t like any of them. All of a sudden, she had an idea! She could make a new dress out of all the old ones! Hayden got out her sewing kit and got to work. She took a satin dress she thought was too long and shortened it. Then she pulled a persimmon ribbon off of another dress and sewed it on the new one. She widened the straps to make it more stunning. Finally, she stitched the whole dress together with golden thread. Now the dress was finished! She spun in front of the mirror so she could see it from all sides. It was perfect! Hayden was ready to go to the dance. She was just in time, too, because her cousin was there to pick her up. She opened the door to show off her new dress.  "How beautiful!"  her cousin said.  "You look just like a person from the Gold Rush!"</p>
