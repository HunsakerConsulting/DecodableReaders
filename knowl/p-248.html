<p>Burt watched a program about the plight of pets in shelters. He did not know that so many pets needed help. He felt it was unfair for the pets to have so little. Burt and his pal Milo came up with a bright plan to help the pets. They held a bake sale to raise cash. Milo kneaded the dough with his hands. After baking them, Burt put the terats in plastic wrap. They put signs up in town. Many folks came by the stand and paid for the sweet terats. Burt and Milo wrote down what everyone paid in a column. At the end of the day, they had made $200! Burt and Milo walked right over to the shelter. They knocked on the door and a lady let them in. They put the money they had raised in her palm. She thanked Burt and Milo and told them that the money helps pay for food and supplies for the pets.</p>
