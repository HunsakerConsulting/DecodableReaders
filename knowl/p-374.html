<p>Camp was dull. Ron went by the pond. There was a log. There was a rope. Ron said, "What can I do with that?" Ron put the rope on the log. He sat on the log. He rode it as if it was a colt! He hung on to the rope and rode, and rode. The sun set. Ron was alone. There was smoke. He ran back to camp. The grill was on! Ron was glad. Dad said, "I hope you are hungry!"</p>
