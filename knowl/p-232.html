<p>Mrs. Pike's class tells about dreams. Mike raises his hand to speak.  "Tell the class your dream, Mike,"  says Mrs. Pike. Mike gets up. "I had a nice dream last night. In my dream, I can fly. I can fly high in the sky. I can fly as high as a kite!"  says Mike. "Were you in a plane?"  asks Mrs. Pike.  "No, I could fly by myself."  "Did you cry?"  asks Meg. "No, but it was bright up there. I wanted to be as high as the sun!"  "Did you feel it was wise to fly so high?"  asks Don. "I cannot tell,"  says Mike,  "but it was fun! I want to fly in the sky in real life."  "Be realistic, Mike. Kids cannot fly,"  says Mrs. Pike.  "I know, but I can dream,"  sighs Mike.</p>
