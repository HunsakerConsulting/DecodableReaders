<p>There are many different kinds of plays. A musical is one type of play. In a musical, there are some spoken words, but much of the play is in song. An actor in a musical has to focus on singing and dancing as well as acting. Many actors in a musical have a singing or dancing specialty. When rehearsing for a musical, the entire cast has to follow a rigid schedule. They cannot get behind in learning the songs or dances or the show may not open in time. Even the actorswith minor parts have to rehearse a lot. When a show begins, the actors cannot be distracted by the audience. They must always focus. Being in a musical can be very rewarding but is a lot of hard work.</p>
