<p>Tom sat in his buggy. He sped along next to a pond. He sang a song his granddad had sung to him. Tom felt happy. But the wind grew strong. The wind hit the buggy. The buggy fell into the pond. The buggy sank. Tom swam to the land. He sat and felt sad until a funny frog swam by and said, "Man, are you wet."</p>
