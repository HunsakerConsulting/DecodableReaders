<p>A library has many services. Sometimes, people may take out books to read, and others may go to do research on different subjects. You can find any book in the entire library by looking in the card catalog. Today, many libraries have a more advanced way of looking for books by using a computer. When searching for a book, find the book number. Then you can go find that number inthe stacks. If you have trouble finding a book, you can ask a librarian for help. Another service a library may have is classes. Perhaps your library has challenging classes! Sometimes libraries have summer reading programs. You can read lots of books and get prizes! You should try to use all your library's services.</p>
