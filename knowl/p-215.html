<p>* a bath or backyard pool to float the boat in First, cut a rectangle of cardboard about thirty by fifteen centimeters. Use a ruler to draw a rectangle at one end of your cardboard, three centimeters from each side and about ten centimeters long. At the other end, draw a bow, the pointy bit at the front of a boat, as shown in the picture. Cut out your rectangle and put it to one side. You will need it later to use as a paddle. Then cut along your boat-shaped lines. Now, take the rectangle that you set aside and trim it by about seven millimeters on all sides. This does not have to be exact, but the paddle will need room to move freely when it is put back into the space you cut it from. Also, keep in mind that the duct tape will make the space narrower. Cover the cardboard shapes with duct tape so your boat does not get soggy and sink. Slip the rubber band onto your boat across the empty space you cut out. Slide the paddle  into the rubber band. Wind it up by twisting it around and let it go. If the paddle does not turn freely, trim it a bit more. After testing, you can staple the rubber band to the paddle to hold it in place. Wind up the paddle again. Hold it firmly and twist it around and around to increase the tension of the rubber band. Once you have twisted the rubber band at least 20 times, put the boat in a bath or backyard pool and let it go. If you enjoyed making your boat, you could make boats with your friends and have boat races.</p>
