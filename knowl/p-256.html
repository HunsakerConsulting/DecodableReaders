<p>If you get a puppy, you need to take care of it. A puppy can be a lot of work. Puppies need fresh water each day. They also need to be fed twice a day. A puppy needs exercise or it might get restless and have an accident inside. Puppies like to chew on things. It is wise to find a toy that the puppy can chew on. A puppy can be hard to train. If your puppy needs training, take it to obedience classes. In these classes, you can teach the puppy to sit and shake hands. You will have to keep up the training at home. A puppy needs to play with you or it will feel neglected. Make sure you have the time to take care of a puppy.</p>
