<p>Before the introduction of the metric system, the mile was the most popular middle distance running race. In the early 1950s, no athlete had run the mile in 4 minutes and the record had stood at 4. "A minutes for nine years. But that was about to change. There were two fierce rivals for the title of first four-minute miler, Roger Bannister in England and John Landy in Australia. In May, 1954, Roger Bannister organised fellow-runners from Oxford University to help him make an assault on the 4-minute mile. A special race, which would only take place if the weather conditions were perfect, was set up in a small track in Oxford, for the sole purpose of enabling Bannister to run the mile in under 4 minutes. Chris Chataway and Chris Brasher acted as pacemakers and, pulled along in their slip steram, Bannister just managed to crack the record with a time of 3:59.4 minutes. Australians were disappointed and felt a bit cheated. However, within a couple of weeks, Landy had also broken the record, in a much faster time. Indeed, his record time of 3:57.9 minutes stood for more than three years. It wasn"t until the 1954 British Empire Commonwealth games that Landy and Bannister actually met in a race for the first time. Dubbed the "Miracle Mile", 10 million people listened to the race on the radio and millions more watched on TV as Landy ran his second sub-4-minute mile but lost to Bannister who ran his best ever time. This race is remembered for its dramatic ending. On the final lap, having led throughout the race, as Landy looked over his left shoulder, Bannister passed him on the right and won. While Landy was the second man to run the mile in less than 4 minutes, he is probably best remembered in Australia for what it did in the 1500 meters final at the 1956 Australian National Championships. Early in the third lap of the race, to the spectators' amazement, Landy stopped and went back to check on fellow runner, Ron Clarke, who had fallen. Clarke, who was the junior 1500 meter world champion at the time, and had been leading the race, got back to his feet and start running again. Landy followed. Incredibly, in the final two laps Landy made up a huge deficit and won the race, which was necessary for him to qualify for the Melbourne Olympics later that year. The incident became a legend in Australian sport, both as a great act of sportsmanship and also for the amazing time Landy ran. John Landy's sterngth of character has been much honoured since that scene, which took place over 60 years ago. In 2001, he was appointed Governor of Victoria, a position he held for 5 years. In 2006, John Landy had the honour of carrying the Queen's Baton into the arena of the Melbourne Commonwealth Games.</p>
