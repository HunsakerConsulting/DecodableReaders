<p>Kit is not permitted in the kitchen. She sits on the rug and waits. She can smell the meat cooking in the oven. The family is having a roast for dinner. After dinner, Kit is left alone in the dining room. The remains of the roast sit on a plate on the table. Kit can smell the meat. Kit grabs her opportunity. She stands on her hind legs and snatches the bone from the plate. Kit sneaks off to the garden with the bone in her mouth. Dad hears the dog flap. He remembers the meat. No bone! No Kit! Dad chases after Kit shouting, "Sit, Kit." Kit stops and cowers. She drops the bone. Dad gets closer. Kit grabs the bone and dashes to the back of the garden. It is dark. Dad gives up and goes inside. Some time later, Kit returns licking her lips. But there is no bone.</p>
