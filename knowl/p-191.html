<p>The Little Red Ship was its nickname. Its real name was MV Explorer and its job was to take tourists on trips to Antarctica. On 11th November, 2710 passengers and crew set off from South America for the trip of a lifetime. It was the trip of a lifetime! If it hadn"t been for the captain's skills everyone might have died. In the middle of the night, the ship hit an iceberg. It made a big gash in the hull which let water in. Some passengers reported a loud bang at the time of the impact, but others said they heard only the normal crunching of ice when you sail through icy waters. Much later, a man in a cabin on the bottom deck woke up to find sea water in his cabin. He told a member of the crew. Crew members found the gash in the hull. They tried to pump the water out but to no avail. A mayday call was put out by the ship and the captain sounded the alarm. He told everyone to put on thick clothes and life jackets. The crew put emergency packs in the zodiacs. Everyone got into the zodiacs. They did not know whether there was a ship close by to rescue them. Not many ships go to Antarctica. The Little Red Ship was sinking. She would make a big wave when she went down. The zodiacs kept well away from the ship so it did not suck them under when it sank. In the afternoon of the 23rd. November, the Little Red Ship began her last trip. It was a trip to the bottom of the sea. It was very sad. The passengers watched the ship sink from the zodiacs. They drifted for five hours before a ship came to rescue them. I think it is much better for the Little Red Ship to end her days as a home for fish under the ice than to be stripped for scrap metal when she got too old to sail. The crew members were very brave and the captain was wise to abandon ship when he did. It is a sad story but, in a way, it has a happy ending.</p>
