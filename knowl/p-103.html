<p>Bump went the bus as it hit the van. Bump went the van as it hit the lamp. Bump went the lamp as it hit the boat. Rock went the boat and upset the duck on its nest. "Quack, quack," went the duck and off it went. Flap. Flap. Flap. Let's go fast: The bus hit the van, the van hit the lamp, the lamp hitthe boat, the boat upset the duck. And the duck went, "Quack, quack, quack!" and left her nest.</p>
