<p>Joan needs to find the roll of stamps she has so she can mail a note. Then she can go on a camping trip. She thinks the roll of stamps is on the desk by the globe. It is not there. Joan's stuff is scattered so she cannot find the roll of stamps. Joan decides to clean the clutter. She hangs her robe and yellow coat on the rack. She makes the bed and sets the foam pillows in place. She folds her clothes. She wipes the desk and globe with a rag. Dust floats in the light from the window. She still cannot find the roll of stamps. Mom hears Joan stomp around the room.  "Joan, do not stomp!"  exclaims Mom. "I need my stamps,"  groans Joan. "I have the stamps!"  says Mom. The stamps were not in Joan's room, but it was so cluttered, she did not know!</p>
