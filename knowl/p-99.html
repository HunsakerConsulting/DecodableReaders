<p>Sniff, sniff. What can Tig smell" Tig can smell pizza. Tig drags the box off the bench and onto the ground. Tig gets stuck into the pizza box. She tugs at the box with her teeth so that she can get at the pizza. Tig grabs a lump of pizza. Dad sees Tig with the pizza and yells at her to stop. But Tig dashes off. Dad catches up with Tig. He is cross. "Bad dog, Tig." Again, Tig runs off. Tig tries to hide behind a shrub. She looks sad. Dad is cross and she has lost the pizza. Dad spots her. Dad hugs Tig. Do you think that Tig was a bad dog"</p>
