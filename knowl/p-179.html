<p>This is the raft that Tim and Jack constructed with a little help from Dad. They found most of the things they needed at the dump: lengths of wood and plastic drums for the raft itself, discarded bus seats to sit on, old pipes to support the roof and a wood-fired stove, complete with flue, for cooking. Back in Dad's shed, they made the frame and attached the plastic drums. A tin roof protected the raft from rain and sun and provided a shelf for extra chairs and the logs of wood needed to fuel the stove. With help from Mum and Dad, the boys lifted the raft onto Dad's trailer and dragged it to the dam. They launched the raft and then Mum and Dad left the boys to it. Along with the dogs, Tim and Jack were all set for an adventure. But were they" Tim and Jack had a problem. What do you think the problem was" Tim and Jack had no means of propelling the raft along: no paddles, no motor, no punting pole, and no way of steering it.</p>
