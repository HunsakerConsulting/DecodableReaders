<p>Poppy was a silly man. He ran to Pip's cabin and said with a gasp, "I invented a rabbit-truck!" Pip sat up in bed. He said, "A what?" Poppy led Pip to his den. In the back was a big red truck...with legs. The legs were metal. There were springs on the legs. Poppy got in the truck. He hit the gas. The truck left the den with one big rabbit hop.</p>
