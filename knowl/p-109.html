<p>Matt is not good at sport. He tends to spend play-time inventing ball games. Mig is a Mugbump. Mig's job is to help kids who are sick or sad. Mig is on her golf club when she sees Matt sitting, looking sad. "What is the problem?" Mig asks. "I have lost my ball and I have no-one to play with." "Hop on and let's see if we can find your ball." Matt soon spots his ball floating in the creek. Mig swoops and Matt grabs the ball. "Let's find a pal you can play with." Unseen, Mig and Matt criss-cross the oval until Matt taps Mig. "Look, Mig. There is Jack. I will ask him to play with me. I have invented a good game." Mig lands and Matt gets off the golf club. "Thanks, Mig," Matt cries as he runs across to Jack. Matt explains the game to Jack. Soon, more children ask to play and Matt adapts the game so that lots of children can play.</p>
