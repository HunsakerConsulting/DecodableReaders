<p>Gerard needed money to buy a fancy bike. First, he took a quick glance under the rug to see if he could find any change. He found a few cents, but he needed a lot more. Gerard sat down to think.  "How can I make money?"  he thought. Then he got an idea!  "I can start a lemonade stand! I?ll charge fifty cents for a large cup."  Gerard asked his mom and dad if it was ok. They thought it was an enterprising idea. Gerard set up his stand. It was a nice, hot day so lots of people came. Gerard sold thirteen cups on his first day. Gerard had some good days and some bad days selling lemonade. Sometimes, he sold apple cider, too. Once, he made fifty-three dollars in a day! After a month, Gerard had enough cash to buy his bike. Gerard was glad he was persistent with his lemonade stand.</p>
