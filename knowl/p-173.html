<p>I tell a tale of Jake the cat. His eyes are yellow, his fur is black. He likes to sit on my best hat And now my hat is very flat. Jake's favourite food is curried rat And pickled mouse comes after that. He likes to sleep on my best hat. My new, best hat is also flat. We told him he must leave the flat We put his food into a sack. We sent him off, but he came back And curled up on my new best hat. We still have Jake the big black cat. He is the boss, and that is that. He sleeps upon my latest hat Which, like the rest, is very flat.</p>
