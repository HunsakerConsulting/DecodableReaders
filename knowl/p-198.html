<p>I took my dog, Kit, for a walk along the beach. The clouds partly hid the sun and the wind howled loudly. At first, Kit scampered happily amongst the rocks but then she disappeared. I called her name, louder and louder. Eventually, there was a soft whimper and she slowly made her way down the rocks and limped towards me. She slumped painfully to the ground at my feet. I lifted Kit and began to carry her home. She was very brave and silently put up with the pain. But gradually she got heavier and heavier until I could no longer hold her. Fortunately, a man drove into his drive just in front of us and I asked him if he would kindly drive Kit and me home. Kit and I sat awkwardly on the front seat, the seatbelt clipped tightly around us. When we got home, I drove Kit straight to the vet. The vet took an X-ray that showed that Kit had broken three ribs. It is likely that her ribs will never heal properly.</p>
