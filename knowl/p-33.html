<p>Optus is an octopus. An octopus has a skull and 8 long tentacles. It has no skeleton and is soft. Optus has spots on his skin. Optus is on the hunt for crabs and clams. He spots a crab sitting still in the sand. He attacks the crab and grabs it in his tentacles. But his tentacles get in a tangle. The crab scuttles off. Optus is glum. Optus sulks until he spots a clam. He sets off on the hunt. He grabs the clam, and gobbles up the soft bits. A clam is top grub for an octopus.</p>
