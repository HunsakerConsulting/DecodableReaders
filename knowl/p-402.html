<p>"One ticket to Planet Odd," Cliff said. The man at the desk put the ticket in his hand. Cliff got on a rocket, and got to Planet Odd just as its king, a parrot with a skunk in its pocket, was banging on a tin box with a banana. "Arrest that man!" the parrot said, with a nod at Cliff. "For what?" said Cliff, and the parrot said with a yell, "Umbrella! Umbrella! You have no umbrella!"</p>
