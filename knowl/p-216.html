<p>Mrs. Wilson is a school principal. Running from the kindergarten to the staff room, she fell and broke her ankle. She was in a lot of pain. Mrs. Wilson hobbled to the staff room and a first aider applied an ice pack. "Ouch! That hurts," Mrs. Wilson complained. A member of staff took Mrs. Wilson to hospital where they x-rayed her ankle and put it in plaster. Mrs. Wilson is now limping around supported by crutches. She expects to go back to school in a week. News of Mrs. Wilson's fall soon got around. "Mum, do you know Mrs. Wilson fell over and broke her leg" There was blood everywhere and an ambulance came to get her." "You know Mrs. Wilson. Well, she had a bad accident today and she is in hospital. She got hit by a car and broke her legs." At After-School Care, several children were keen to share the news of Mrs. Wilson's accident. "Mrs. Wilson fell over this morning. She was on the ground moaning and groaning until the ambulance came to get her." "Yes," added another child. "And she was in a big pool of blood and her leg was all twisted." "Do you think she will die?" asked one child. "I don"t think so," replied the teacher. "But if she does, do you think we will get a day off school, or a present to help us feel better?"</p>
