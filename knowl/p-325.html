<p>Sid dug in his sandbox. He dug until he hit a big box. It was red. There was a lot of rust on it. He dug until he got it up from the sand. He dusted it off. In the box was a lump with fabric across it. With a pull, the fabric was off. The lump was a glass hippo! The hippo had a trumpet in its hand. Sid put it next to his bed.</p>
