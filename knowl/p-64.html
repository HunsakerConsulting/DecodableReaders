<p>The sun is hot. An elephant stomps across the track. It sees a puddle and steps into the mud. The elephant sits in the mud. It lies in the mud. The elephant sucks mud up in its trunk and sprays the mud onto its back. The mud sticks to its skin. Why does an elephant slap mud on its skin" Is it for fun" The mud helps to protect the elephant's skin. It acts as a sunscreen and stops insects and ticks from attacking its skin.</p>
