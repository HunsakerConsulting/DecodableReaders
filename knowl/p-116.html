<p>A Fresh Start for Ned" Back with his faithful band of bandits, Ned tells them his plan. Fed up with jail, he is going to start afresh. He will join the gold rush and try his luck at prospecting for gold. If he gets lucky, he will return to help the inhabitants of Bond. Ned sells his horse and sets off on foot, with a handcart to hold his pick and shovel, swag, tent, metal pans, and cooking equipment. He meets lots of prospectors as he plods along the terrible roads and tracks that lead to the gold diggings. At Cariboo, Ned pays 38 shillings for a claim  for 38 days. Panning for gold. Ignoring the flies and the hot sun, Ned works from dawn to dusk, determined to find, not just gold dust, but a big gold nugget: a nugget he can sell for lots of cash. As he works, Ned mutters to himself, "Loosen the gravel andsand on the creek bed with the pick, dip the pan in the water and fill it with sand and gravel, shake the pan to sort the gold from the gravel and sand. Let mud and silt float up and out of the gold pan. Drain off the water and check the gravel for gold. Then start again. Loosen the ..." At night, when it is cold, Ned sleeps in his tent. When it is hot, he lies under the stars in his swag. When he sleeps, Ned dreams of finding a big nugget of gold. And then it happens. Sick and sad, his last shilling spent, Ned tries a new spot at the bend in the creek. He dips in his gold pan and as he is checking the gravel, he sees a glint of metal. Ned has found a big nugget of gold. He is rich. He can go back to Bond and join the gang. Tom, Pip and Sam are waiting when Ned gets off the train in Bond. That night they discuss how to make amends for their bad deeds.</p>
