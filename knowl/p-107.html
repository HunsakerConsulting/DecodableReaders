<p>Mig is a Mugbump. Her job is to cheer children up who are sick or sad. To do her job, Mig flies on a golf club, unseen by adults. Let me tell you about Mig and Amanda. Amanda fell off a swing and cut her legs on the gravel. The doctor put dressings on the cuts and said she must lie still in bed. Amanda cried. It was no fun in bed. Mig spotted Amanda in her bedroom and went to help. "What is the problem?" said Mig. "I have cuts on my legs and I have to lie still in bed." "Let me help. I shall sit on the bed and when I say, Boo-, grab the bed." "oK" Boo-boom." Mig and Amanda are transported to the mugbumps" hospital where they are met by the top doctor. The doctor looks at Amanda's legs, claps her hands and the cuts on Amanda's legs vanish. "Fantastic!"" cries Mig. Mig taps the bed and in seconds, Amanda is back in her bedroom. She looks at her legs and sees that the cuts have gone. Amanda runs to tell her mum that her legs are better but she does not tell her mum about Mig and the mugbump doctor.</p>
