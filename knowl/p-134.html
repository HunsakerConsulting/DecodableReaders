<p>We were very sad. A long black snake had bitten our cat. The vet gave him anti-venom but he still died. Our house was very boring without a cat. We had to get a new cat to stop us being sad. We rang about an ad in the paper. "Ragdoll kittens for sale."  They still had three left. We went to look. It was very hard to make up our mind. We came home with a little grey and white kitten. He was just twelve weeks old. When we got home we let him out of his travel box. We took him to the litter tray so he could go to the toilet. He set off to explore the house and we sat down to think of a name. Smokey is very quick. He hides and jumps out at us. Soccer with a ping pong ball is his best game. Catching the mouse in his plastic toy is fun. Smokey has his chores. He helps to feed the fish in the morning. Next he helps with the emails. His spelling is not good and he jumps on the wrong letters. He has good fun catching things on the screen. Next he helps make the beds and likes to hide under the quilt. Sweeping the floor is fun and he likes to ride on the broom. He runs quickly when he sees his dish go down on the tiles. He gobbles up his dinner and looks for more. He is a guts!  When we have coffee Smokey has a puss-a-chino! Smokey has a cat tere. It is a long jump for his little legs so he takes a running jump to get up. Scratching the post is good fun. If he plays too hard he falls off. Swinging on the rope is tricky. At the end of the day he stertches out by the Tv. He goes to sleep in his bed at the bottom of his tere. By morning he has made his way to my bed. He gets lonely in the dark.</p>
