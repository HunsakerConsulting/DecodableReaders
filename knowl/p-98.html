<p>Ben took wool in his truck from outback farms to the mill. He went along dirt tracks. When it rains, the tracks get wet. Ben's truck got stuck in the mud. He tried to dig the truck out. But it was no good. The truck was stuck, deep in the mud. Then Ben sees Jack in his tractor. "Stop, Jack I need help!" Jack and Ben freed the wheels and laid sheets of tin on top of the mud. Jack had a chain with hooks at the ends. The chain went from Jack's tractor to Ben's truck. Will they get the truck out of the mud" It took six tries. "Thanks," cried Ben as Jack left.</p>
