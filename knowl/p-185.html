<p>Charlie couldn"t believe what had happened to Clarissa, his mother. One minute she seemed so big and strong, so speedy, so beautiful and reliable. Then, suddenly, the man of the house had turned on the light and spotted Mum. In spite of being able to change direction 2 times every second, thanks to the many knees on her legs, she was stamped on and squashed-splat-on the kitchen floor! Then the man filled glasses with water from the tap, carried them from the kitchen and turned out the light. Charlie knew, from his mother's lessons on how to find food in the dark, that the man and woman, whose kitchen he lived in, spent the night sleeping in the room next door. He also knew that sometimes they ate pizza, or bars of chocolate, in bed and left scraps of food on the floor and on the pillows. Chocolate was Charlie's favourite food. Every night, the man and the woman had two glasses of water each on a table beside their bed. Charlie and his brothers and sisters sometimes drank from the glasses. They even swam in the water on hot nights, just for fun. There were scary moments when the man or woman reached out to take a sip and they had to get out quickly to avoid being swallowed! Charlie shared his plan with his sisters and brothers. Each of them was to carry a part of their mother's remains into the bedroom. Cockroaches are surprisingly strong and sometimes carry up to their own weight. Charlie had told them not to eat any of the parts. Cockroaches are prepared to eat anything. They even eat other roaches at times!  But they did what Charlie told them and really weren"t very hungry after seeing their mother's death. Slowly, parts of Clarissa's crushed body parts were dropped into the four glasses. Pieces of head, brain, eyes, gut, heart, wings, bits of legs and antennae swelled in the water. When the man and the woman woke up next morning, they both felt sick when they realised that the water they had been drinking in the night contained bits of cockroach!  They felt  ven worse when they saw that the glasses, in which they had been soaking their false teeth, also had bits of cockroach floating in the water! In fact, they never really got over feeling sick whenever they saw a glass of water! They could not forget the sight of floating cockroach body parts the morning after Clarissa died.</p>
