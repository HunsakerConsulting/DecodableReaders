<p>Horses have always been important to American culture. In early colonial times, people used horses to help with farming and travel. They would use bridles to help control the horses. Wild horses used to run free throughout the United States, but as more people came to the country, they started to become tame. A wild horse is also called a mustang. Today, mustangs only live in the western states. Mustangs can find sanctuary in lands that are protected by the federal government. It is difficult to keep this land because people want to develop it into homes and malls. Habitat is very important to wild horses. It is an ongoing battle to protect them. You are able to see these beautiful creatures if you visit a sanctuary in the West.</p>
