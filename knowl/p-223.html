<p>There was always the tinkle of music in the toy shop on the high steret. As Christmas drew near, the music changed to the carols Annie knew so well. Children went in on their way home from school, first to look and then to show their parents or grandparents the toys they liked best. Each day on her way home from school, Annie passed the toy shop. Each day she peered through the window to admire the toys. Then one day she gathered up her courage, opened the door and went inside. The bell tinkled. Annie marvelled at the sight of so many toys but the toy she wanted most was a musical box with a ballerina whose head had broken off. The head lay abandoned on the shelf. Day after day, Annie went into the shop and wandered around. Each day she stopped and gazed at the broken ballerina. Then, one day the old shopkeeper asked her if he could help. She told him she wanted to buy the musical box so she could repair the ballerina but her family was poor and she had no money. "Well, you can"t have it," the man replied firmly. Disappointed, but accepting, Annie left. As soon as she had gone, the shopkeeper felt bad. What good was the musical box to him" He should have thrown it away years ago. He went to the door but the girl had disappeared. He waited for her the next day, but she didn"t return. More than a week passed before he saw the girl again gazing in through the window. He hobbled to the door and invited her inside. Then, he heard himself not only offer to give her the musical box but to mend it as well. Annie watched in amazement as the pieces were carefully fitted together. The old man was pleased with his work but his pleasure was nothing compared to that of the little girl. Carefully he wrapped up the musical box and handed it to Annie. It was the first toy she had ever owned.</p>
