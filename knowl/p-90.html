<p>Ben, the captain of The Big Catch and three of his friends set off from the little port of Brigton on a fishing trip. It is 6 p.m. The men are expecting a normal run, but they are in for a shock. The plan is for Ben to steer the boat as they motor to the fishing grounds and for his pals to snatch some sleep in the cabin. To begin with, all goes to plan. They drop the nets when they get to the fishing grounds and have just dragged them in with a good catch of fish when the wind gets up. There will be no more sleep for the men. All hands are needed on deck. Ben is at the helm as the wooden boat battles back to shore. The water crashes against it and the boat rocks as it is hit by the swell. As long as the motor keeps chugging along we will get back OK, Ben thinks to himself. But the next moment the swell is so big that the boat begins to ship water. The men attempt to bail it out with buckets but with little success. The boat is sinking. The men are terrified. They chuck the fish and the nets into the water to lessen the load and wait as Ben radios for help. It is not long before the local lifeboat approaches the boat. Ben and his chums scramble onto the boat. The Big Catch is tied to the stern and they soon find themselves back on land.</p>
