<p>A tennis ball fell from the back of a truck, and with one hop as big as the next, went across town. It sped past a class full of kids as they did jumping jacks. It twisted along the rim of a pond with a duck swimming in it. It fell in the mud next to the pond, but a hotrod blasted past, and the wind behind it sent the ball up...and back into the truck it fell from.</p>
