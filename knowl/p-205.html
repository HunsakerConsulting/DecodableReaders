<p>Did you know that the sinking of the Titanic could have been avoided" Titanic, a British passenger liner, was the largest ship afloat when she left Southampton on April 10th, 1912 on her maiden voyage to New York. Photographs show a magnificent interior. So, it is not surprising that rich English and Americans were keen to get hold of first class tickets. The ship's owners were so sure that the Titanic was seaworthy that, when they were told that there were not enough life boats to take all the passengers and crew, they did nothing about it. They were sure that the Titanic was unsinkable. But they were wrong. What the ship's owners had not reckoned with was human error. And so, just before midnight on 15th April, 1912, after hitting an iceberg, Titanic sank and more than 1,500 people drowned. The main people involved in the disaster were determined to protect themselves and the ship's owners from prosecution and so important facts did not come out in court and the story that the ship was travelling too fast was accepted. More recent investigations have found that the death of so many people could have been prevented:. if the command from the bridge when the iceberg was first sighted had not been misinterpreted, causing the helmsman to turn the ship in the wrong direction. if the ship had stopped when it hit the iceberg instead of steaming off again. This made a long gash along one side of the vessel and caused water to pour into the separate compartments of the broken hull.. if the radio room on the Californian, the closest ship at the time the Titanic sank, had been operated 24 hours a day. if there had been enough lifeboats for all the crew and passengers. In fact, there were only enough places on the life boats for 1500 people, just over half of the 2200 on the ship. The sinking of the Titanic and the loss of so many lives demonstrated the need for maritime rules that were followed by all countries. New safety measures were put in place:. A ship's radio had to be monitored 24 hours a day. an international ice patrol was set up to look out for icebergs in the North Atlantic. an international agreement was made listing minimum safety standards at sea.</p>
