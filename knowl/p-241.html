<p>Doris is bored. She has nothing to do. The sky is dark and the grass is wet so she cannot play sports in the park. She sits on the porch swing and watches the rain. She hears a dog barking in someone's yard. Doris's pals are not home. They cannot play. Doris has chores but she doesn?t want to do them. She ignores doing her chores. Then she gets an idea. She could spin around! That would be fun! So Doris starts to spin and spin. She spins so fast she cannot see. She holds her arms out to the side as she spins. She is a whirlwind! It is fun, but then Doris starts feeling dizzy. She needs to stop. Doris stops spinning and falls down. That was not a good idea. No more spinning for Doris!</p>
