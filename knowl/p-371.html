<p>The wise rat had a plan. He was hungry. He got the big dog. The rat said, "What do you think of candy?" "Yum," said the big dog. "It's fine!" The rat said, "There is a box of candy by the bed!" The dog went to the box. He got the lid off. There was the candy. The dog ran off with a bit of candy. With the lid off, the rat can get to the rest of the pile!</p>
