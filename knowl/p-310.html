<p>Regis and Cindy like to play. "Let's make a fancy electric car that can fly to the moon!" said Cindy. "Good!" exclaimed Regis. "First, use this pen to sketch the car. Then we can use the drawing to make a model of the car." Cindy took the pen and began to draw. Since Regis wasn?t drawing, she went to get supplies. "We need paper for the body of the car. We also need four circles for the wheels" he whined. "Can you help me?" "YesI will help" said Cindy. She found a pile of round rocks. "These are circles. We can use these for the wheels." Regis got red paint for Cindy. She painted the fancy electric car red and put the wheels on it. "Let's go!" said Regis, jumping into the car. "To the moon we go!" Cindy yelled. Brice in Space When Brice gets older, he wants to be an astronaut. "I want to go to space" he told his teacher. "That is a very good ideaBrice" said Mrs. Price. "But you must study a lot before you can go to the moon! It is important to work hard now." Brice grinned as he thought about what he does every day. He always listens in class and does his homework. He really enjoys reading books. He even visits a science center on weekends. He dreams of placing his feet on the moon and making footprints. "Yes, it is important to study" Brice said to Mrs. Price. "But I do not mind. I like to study, and someday I will walk on the moon!"</p>
