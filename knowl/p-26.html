<p>Dem and I set up a pretend tram on Grandma's deck. Dem is the tram driver. He sits in the cabin at the front. He has a cap. I am the conductor. I have a cap. I stand at the back. I collect the fares, clip the tickets and ring the bell. Grandma sits in the middle. She has a picnic basket on her lap. Ding. Ding. I ring the bell. The tram rattles off along the tram track. Click, clack, click, clack. Grandma, Dem and I rock as the tram rumbles along. A man signals the tram to stop. He steps onto the tram. It is grandpa. I ring the bell and grab a handle as the tram sets off. Grandpa sits. He pays me. I hand him a ticket and clip it. When the tram gets to Glenelg, I call, "End of the line." Grandma and Grandpa hop off. And so do Dem and I. Grandma, Grandpa, Dem and I have a picnic on the grass.</p>
