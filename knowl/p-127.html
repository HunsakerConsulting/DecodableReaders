<p>Allanbee and Kolya went on a trip in an old jeep. It was in the big wet and they had lots of problems. First, it began to rain. The road got wet and the jeep got stuck in a big puddle. Allanbee and Kolya tried to get the jeep out of the puddle, but the wheels were stuck in the wet sand. A bus load of students stopped to help. Allanbee, Kolya and the students got soaking wet as they pushed the jeep out of the wet sand. Then, off went the students in the bus and Allanbee and Kolya set off on the road again. Next, the jeep got a flat tyre. As Allanbee and Kolya fixed the tyre, they got drenched. They had been planning to sleep in the open, but it was too wet. On they went, singing songs to entertain themselves until the jeep got stuck in a deep rut. Allanbee and Kolya tried to get the jeep out of the rut but it was no good. The wheels were stuck in the wet sand. Allanbee and Kolya got back in the jeep and waited for help. They were in luck. A truck driver stopped to help them. He attached a chain to the jeep and dragged the jeep out of the rut. Allanbee and Kolya waited in the rain. Then, they set off again. The rain drips off their hats and jackets. Their socks are soaking wet and mud is sticking to their boots. Allanbee and Kolya agree to go back. All went well and they began to sing. But soon it got dark. Allanbee and Kolya could not see the ruts in the road. What do you think they did" Allanbee and Kolya parked on the side of the road and went to sleep in the jeep.</p>
